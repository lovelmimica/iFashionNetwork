Selena Gomez <a href="https://www.vogue.com/vogueworld/article/selena-gomez-coachella-performance-ruffles-lace-style">looked chic with a double-breasted white blazer and trousers</a>. The outfit’s lace and ruffled plus gold necklaces and rings added the former Disney stars sparkle at the event.

That was the first time for the “Who Says” singer to perform Taki Taki live since the song’s release in 2018, marking her first show at the Coachella held in Indio, California.

Cardi B and DJ Snake did not want to lose that moment by taking the pic and uploading it on their Instagram accounts. While Gomez preferred posting her backstage image.

Selena Gomez’s performance at the Coachella was her first in public after undergoing treatment for anxiety and depression last October. She also just underwent kidney transplantation.

The last time she was seen at Coachella show was two years ago when she spotted her then-boyfriend The Weeknd.

This festival seemed to deliver a piece of good news that Selena will be back after a long hiatus. She is planning to perform at WE WE in California on April 25.

<strong>Selena’s comeback does not sound surprising</strong>

Last March, Selena hinted that she was working on her new album and she was nervous about it. The 26-year-old singer added that she tried to be patient with the recording process.

She uploaded a picture of herself in the studio when she was sick.

“Here’s my new record in the making lol (while I was sick),” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BoBdx-Ng9JC/?utm_source=ig_embed">Gomez said in her Instagram post.</a>

Selena Gomez has not announced the exact date of her upcoming album’s release yet. Last January, Gomez featured with singer Julia Michaels in the latter’s song titled “Anxiety.” The video has been watched more than 45 million times.

Her first single in 2019 was “It Aint’Me” which features Norwegian DJ Kygo. This song can be something Gomez’s fans miss given calm and sexy music associated with Justin Bieber’s ex-girlfriend.

Her ups and downs, from a broken relationship to illness has made the singer stronger than ever. Selena Gomez is ready to entertain us again. Besides her singles, she was prepared to take part in 13 Reasons Why series as an executive producer in March.

“Selena is sitting on a ton of new, unreleased music. She is waiting to be in a place where she feels strong enough physically, emotionally and mentally before she releases any more music or a whole album. Selena knows it will take a lot of energy to support a new album, and even possibly a tour, so she wants to wait until she feels 1000% before sharing more music with her fans. She is hoping 2019 will be a big year for her, a big comeback, with more acting, more music and a return to social media too. She loves and misses her fans and can’t wait to get back to work”, <a href="https://guardian.ng/life/selena-gomez-ready-to-make-a-2019-comeback/">a source close to the star told HollywoodLife in November 2018.</a>','post_excerpt' => '','post_date' => '2019-04-20 00:22:13'),
  array('post_name' => 'uniqlo-collaborates-with-alexander-wang-to-launch-exclusive-collection','post_title' => 'Uniqlo Collaborates With Alexander Wang to Launch Exclusive Collection','post_content' => 'Japan’s fashion titan Uniqlo has launched its latest collection by collaborating with world-class designer Alexander Wang. Underwears have become the focus of the Uniqlo x Wang collaboration project.

The Uniqlo x Alexander Wang collection consists of men’s and women’s underwears, from bras, leggings, bodysuits to boxers. The prices range between $15 and $ 35

&nbsp;

Vogue reported U.S consumers can get the latest collection starting from the end of this month. While Uniqlo announced its global release as well.

The first Wang-Uniqlo collaboration took place ten years ago when the designer released his first label. Wang said the relationship between him and the brand is still good, praising Uniqlo’s CEO Tadashi Yanai for being supportive and open to new ideas for collaboration.

“Working with UNIQLO on the second season of the collaboration, it felt like there was a mutual understanding of not only aesthetics but of each other’s work ethic,” <a href="https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/alexander-wang-uniqlo-second-collection">Wang said</a> as instyle.com quoted.

Last year, Uniqlo partnered with designer JW Anderson to release holiday-theme capsules.

What makes this  Uniqlo x Wang collection special is that it is suitable for all occasions. As Vogue wrote last year, Wang gave some tricks about wearing a bra as an upper part combined with high-waisted jeans and denim jackets. With the bra’s sporty and stylish design, it will be displayed as “the seen outfit.” All underwear types are available in white and Wang’s favorite color, neon green.

<strong>The Background of Uniqlo’s Collaboration with Notable Fashion Designers</strong>

Tadashi Yanai once sold imported branded stuff such as Nike and Adidas in the 1980s, but he was not satisfied and wanted to set up his own.

He had a dream to have his brand that could be as big as Marks&amp;Spencers, Esprit, and Bennetton. When he did not know what to do, Yanai met advertising company John Jay, who once designed a marketing model for a famous shopping center Bloomingdale.

Jay suggested that Yanai produce innovation-based casual outfits. Then, we have seen the types of innovative products as Airism (clothes we can wear in a high-temperature room), Lightweight (ultra-light garments), and Heat-Tech (that can maintain a body’s temperature).

Yanai realized that he and his team is not good enough in exploring ideas for many types of designs for Uniqlo’s items of clothing. Therefore, Yanai decided to collaborate with famous designers from the U.S and European countries to expand the market and make Uniqlo the top retailer.

In 2018, Uniqlo had 1.246 outlets worldwide. The sales are expected to reach $ 44 billion in 2020.','post_excerpt' => '','post_date' => '2019-04-20 00:29:04'),
  array('post_name' => 'camp-notes-met-gala-2019','post_title' => 'Camp Notes: Met Gala 2019','post_content' => 'The 71st Costume Institute Gala, also known as the Met Ball or Met Ball took place on 6th May 2019 this year. The annual invitation-only fundraising event for the benefit of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute was held in New York City. The tickets cost upwards of $30,000 each. It is the inauguration of the institute’s annual exhibition, which runs for months after the Met Gala. The fashion industry’s premier red carpet event, the affair is attended by a symphony of personalities from the fields of art like film, music, fashion, high society, etc. Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue has been a chair with Gala since 1995. She oversees both the benefit committee and the guest list.

Met gala has a new theme every year. It has a cocktail hour where guests walk the red carpet in their gorgeous outfits. They are then given an exclusive first look of the exhibition followed by cocktails and a formal dinner hour before they hit the dance floor. This year’s Met Ball theme was, “Camp, Notes on Fashion.” Camp here does not mean tents, treks, and bonfires. The theme is inspired by an essay by Susan Sontag’s 1964 essay, "Notes on camp." In her essay, Susan describes camp as the love of unnatural and that of artifice and exaggeration. In simple term, the theme for this year was exaggerated, ironic, humorous, parody, artifice and theatrical fashion. And boy! The celebrities did not disappoint. The Met Gala was hosted by Lady Gaga and Harry Styles this year. The entire event was sponsored by the luxury brand, Gucci. The brand’s representatives, Alessandro Michele and tennis icon Serena Williams joined the hosts as co-chairs for this year’s Met Gala.

From the bizarre makeup design by Ezra Miller to the four outfit changes of Lady Gaga, the night saw quite a lot of interpretation of Camp Notes. Billy Porter came with golden wings and Joan Collins gave “Dynasty” a major reboot. Jared Leto came along with a replica of his own head and Jordon Roth printed the interiors of an Opera House on his cape. Kacey Musgraves was seen channeling her inner Barbie whereas Zendaya chose to be a fairy godmother. The Kardashian-Jenner Clan too didn’t disappoint. Katy Perry was the central piece of a chandelier. Michael Urie went for two looks in a single outfit. There was also an impressive range of feathers, capes and head accessories gracing the Met Gala red carpet.

The exhibition will be featuring over 200 pieces from both Men’s and Women’s Fashion. Sculptures, painting, and drawings spanning from the 17th Century till today will also be on display. Majorly the exhibition wants to focus on camp notes and how can be expressed in the worlds of fashion. There is a play on a lot of emotions and how fashion can help express and feel these emotions. Versailles will also be highlighted with the queer subcultures of Europe and America from the 19th and early 20th centuries. “We are going through an extreme camp moment, and it felt very relevant to the cultural conversation to look at what is often dismissed as empty frivolity, but can be actually a very sophisticated and powerful political tool, especially for marginalized cultures,” Andrew Bolton, Costume Institute curator, told the Times.

It was the theme of this year’s Met Gala. But hardly anyone could outdo the force that was Lady Gaga, this year’s Met Gala host along with Harry Styles. Lady Gaga has shown she can pull all stops on the red carpet in the past and this night was no different. A night before the Met Gala, she pulled off an over the top Marc Jacobs back and white ruffle dress accessorized by a tiny purse and sky-high platform boots to kick start the countdown hours for the ball.

Returning to the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute Gala after a two-year hiatus, Lady Gaga was one of the first to arrive at this year’s Gala. She stepped onto the red carpet in a beautiful and outrageously fuchsia pink parachute cape gown with a 25-foot train, a huge pink hair bow, and a mile long gold foil lashes. The gold lashes added a dramatic look to her entire ensemble. The costume was designed by her friend and designer, Brandon Maxwell. Maxwell accompanied Gaga along with her glam squad and tuxedoed backup dancers who performed a whole choreography of fawning over while using umbrellas as props. Gaga, who had already got the nod of approval from critics and fan alike did something which could be termed nothing less than performing arts.

After posing for several photographs, she opened her to the cape to reveal a gorgeous black couture gown, which she posed with a black umbrella to complete the look. It was a stunning piece of the black strapless gown, which accentuate her figure greatly. She looked beautiful and onlookers were quite impressed by her. Little did they know, she was planning on blowing their minds. A third outfit has changed followed with Gaga now in a hot pink gown complete with a giant black cell phone bag, a diamond necklace and decked with a pair of giant black sunglasses. She then very flamboyantly went on to do her lipstick on the red carpet and adjust her make-up. People thought this was it, but then there was the final performance. In what felt like a burlesque performance, Lady Gaga stripped down to her crystal-studded bra and pantyhose while pulling a hot pink wagon full of rosé and pink cowboy hats.

&nbsp;

This act could not have pulled off by just about any naive artist. Lady Gaga too is no novice, seeing her previous track records on the red carpets. But this time, every outfit of hers was an ode to a phase of her life. Art is what she lives by and art is what she delivered on this night.

Coco Chanel explained this as the reason for her Haute Couture brand, Chanel.  Started in 1909 by Coco Chanel herself, Chanel gradually expanded from a shop selling simple clothes to becoming a haute couture boutique store.  A post world wars, Chanel expanded itself from clothing and expanded into the territory of perfumes and jewelry. The perfume Chanel no. 5 which was launched in 1921 is still considered one of the best perfumes in the world. Coco Chanel along with her various business partners successfully ran the brand until her demise in 1971. Post her  death, Chanel was taken over by Alain Wertheimer, the man who brought Karl Lagerfeld to Chanel.

Karl Lagerfeld became the creative director of Chanel in 1983, at a time when the brand was dying and was in dire need of new blood. He revamped and introduced the ready to wear fashion line for women. He also  integrated the interlocked "CC" monograph of Coco Chanel into a style pattern for the fashion house. He, in short brought Chanel back to life. During his time at Chanel, Lagerfeld also became the creative director of Fendi and started his own brand, The Karl Lagerfeld brand.

On February\'19, Lagerfeld passed away after suffering from pancreatic cancer. Lagerdeld was known for his outspoken views on all topics. He was not the one to mince his words. He made the careers of several models and designers. With his help, Chanel became one of the biggest haute couture houses in the world. He was a fashion icon in the business whose advice help great value.  His death was mourned by the world, especially by the House of Chanel. His death was described as, "the end of an era" and they were not wrong. After loosing it\'s creative director of 35 years, the question arises, what next for the House of Chanel?

Post  his death, The House of Chanel announced on their Instagram page, that the new creative director of Chanel will be, Virgine Viard. She will be the first woman to lead Chanel since the legendary Coco Chanel herself. Viard has been Lagerfeld\'s closest collaborator since over 30 years now.  She has been working for him since 1987, when she first joined Lagerfeld as his intern and has remained by his side ever since then. She was called his right hand woman in the world of fashion and had been bowing with him at a lot of fashion shows in the last few years. She previously held the post of Director of Chanel\'s Fashion Creation Studio. She was also picked to ensure that the legacy of Coco Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld lives on.

On May 3, 2019 - a couple of months after the death of Lagerfeld, Viard launched her first solo collection in Paris, France. The Chanel Cruise 2020 collection opened to a star studded event to positive reviews. It is early days and a tough road for Viard but she is someone who understood Lagerfeld well. She understands the fabrics to be used and the style of House Chanel from over the years. These are exciting time for the fashion brand as after a long time the reigns of the Haute Couture house are in the hands of a woman once again.

Makeup is often used by people to cover the flaws of the face, like pimples acne pigmentation\'s etc. The definition of beauty has changed over the years. It is not really easy living in today\'s society with a flaw or an imperfection. Similarly, when one thinks of a cosmetic campaign or advertisements, one thinks of flawless models with skinny bodies. This is has become the norm to define beauty mostly established by fashion brands. And then enters Gucci, a luxury brand which has attempted to break this said define beauty mold.

Alessandro Michele became the creative director of Gucci in 2015. He has since then relaunched the entire brand with a completely new narrative and Gucci\'s beauty launch was a proof of that. He tapped the talented Thomas de Kluyver, Gucci\'s Global Makeup Artist for this project.  The launched a collection of 58 lipstick shades in three categories: Rouge à Lèvres Satin (with a satin finish), Rouge à Lèvres Voile (with a sheer finish), and Baume à Lèvres (a silky smooth lip balm with a translucent finish).  He made punk star Dona Miller the leading lady for his campaign. She is shown smiling and revealing her crooked teeth while wearing the Gucci Goldie Red Lipstick. She is joined by other models. A close up of their lips wearing the newly launched lipstick smiling  with engaging imperfections is used for the advertisement campaign.

Michele launched this collection to convey the notion that makeup need not intimidating. “The idea is to create a humanized point of view, however strange, but the strangeness is human, so it\'s beautiful.” It is a beautiful, compelling and a timely sentiment. Kluyver added, "I want (makeup) to be used in a positive way, and I think we\'re going in a really positive direction with that", he told Allure. Most of the lipsticks can be used on the cheeks and some of them can be used on the eyes too.

Artist Tina Barney has taken inspiration from old artistic masters to create the campaign. She has photographed five models for Gucci\'s debut cosmetic range. The lipsticks have also drawn inspiration from Hollywood. They are named after some of the actresses from the golden era of Hollywood. "There is no re-touching done. I don\'t want any filters. There are already too many. Beauty is power", Michele said after the completion of the shoot. The packaging is also inspired from those times.

For Michele, the focus on the lips came from his mother\'s passion about lipsticks. They were everywhere, he fondly recalls. He also picked lipstick to debut to break the mold that they can be only worn by women. He want to let men know that cosmetics do not depict femininity, they can be worn by anyone and everyone. "Lipstick is a little bit erotic, you can change very quickly just with a swipe."

These lipsticks are priced at $38 a piece. They will be available on Gucci\'s website from 6th May and exclusively at Saks Fifth Avenue New York Flagship nationwide and on Saks.com from 29th May.','post_excerpt' => '','post_date' => '2019-05-11 15:17:58'),

The creator of these, Shannon Ashford is a SoCal native most likely to be found with her bare feet in the sand quoting Will Ferrell comedies. Her curiosity has taken her around the world, up mountaintops, down sea caves, and out of open plane hatches. Always finding the light in others, her goal is to dress you to match the beauty within. She describes these rompers as the perfect manifestation of the energy and adventure of a tomboy packaged as a classy lady. Her brand\'s goal was not just to make visually appealing garments but to maintain the integrity in the production process too. All her fabrics are are made from plastic bottles collected in Haiti. She has been able to help in the re-usage of around 1200 of plastic bottles till now. She also works with fabric companies which employees locals and provides them with a fair wage and benefits.

What Does this Really Mean?','post_content' => '<p style="text-align: center;">The  fashion world changed as we knew it after April 2013. Due to the collapse of a factory in Savar, Bangladesh, where 1,127 people passed away and 2,437 others injured, thus life has never been the same.  Fashion Revolution was born from this global impact.</p>

How many people asked themselves what was the reason for this to have happened and what were the effects of this tragedy in the fashion world?  The cracks and the unacceptable state in which this building was, where many people worked daily to make the garments for big brands, were the result of this tragedy. But, today, we are not going to talk about the event, although it would deserve a complete article about it. Today we are going to talk about Fashion Revolution. This is the name of the organization which have been created after this travesty. It was founded in the United Kingdom (UK). These people are designers, producers, photographers, who wanted to give FASHION a different meaning and path going forward.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-20021 size-full" src="https://www.ifashionnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fashion-revolution-day-2017.jpg" alt="" width="1580" height="889" />

This catastrophe allows many people to understand which were the conditions in which the garments were produced. Behind every garment there were, and cheerlessly still are, many people who work under unacceptable human conditions. Fashion Revolution was created in order to be able to publicize and inform about this reality.
This organization believes in real fashion, where the values of people are important, where the environment is being taken into account, and where creativity and profit are in equal measure because that is what is fair.
The main goal is entirely changing the way that clothes are fabricated by understanding who are the people behind these machines that create each garment and by giving them the importance they deserve. Also, they want to educate and inform people how is the best way to consume.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-20019 size-full" src="https://www.ifashionnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/8e1738df11cc2ea6e70704195408e88c.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="600" />

Their aim is to create a change and make people believe in that. The essential way of seeing this is to inspire those who buy or that they are on thinking in to create their own brand, to go and make it happen but through an ethical and sustainable way. It\'s important to mention that they don’t want people to feel guilty because of the way of consuming. Fashion Revolution wants to help them to be conscious about this, and that they have the power to do something to make a positive change. Despite being talking about the "dark" side of fashion, what Fashion Revolution is trying to do is believe in fashion but in a different way. Transparency. Taking into account the environment and above all the dignity of human work.

<img class="wp-image-20018 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.ifashionnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Fashion-Revolution-Day_Abadesi-940x529.jpg" alt="" width="940" height="529" />

The organization is huge. With more than 100 countries who created their headquarters, to support and be able to transmit this same message. Under the values ​​and beliefs of each society. The message is clear, it is to educate and mobilize people to produce and consume in a different way. To commemorate and reinforce this message.  Fashion Revolution week has been created for some time now. From the 22nd to the 28th of April it is reinforced and strengthened even more because Fashion Revolution was born. With the hashtag #whomademyclothes most brands and producers they go on stage demonstrate transparency in their supply chain.

This is something important. This is something big. Fashion Revolution was created so that all of us are aware of who creates the clothes we choose every day. Under what conditions they manufacture it, how much money they pay to those people and how much we buy it. This organization was created in order to help fashion to be more dignified and stronger. The future rules will be the same for everyone, in all sectors and areas.

<p style="text-align: left;">We are in a new era where large buildings are being converted into offices full of people, a multi-space filled with various professions.  Co-working is the new fashion. You can be a graphic designer or the CEO of a multinational company and be sitting next to a fashion designer who is developing her latest collection. Sounds scary? But it works. And today is what many professionals choose. Today the co-working idea is where the company becomes a community, it’s about unfitting different components.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As far as we know, it all began in 2005 when Brad Neuberg opened the doors of his home in California so that colleagues or people who had nowhere to work find a place where they can develop their work. In these spaces, the main idea is to be able to find colleagues who are in your environment, or in the same playing field but also having the possible collaboration with other professionals from different areas, which generates greater creativity and innovation to your project.  There are countless co-working spaces that have emerged over the years all around the globe including one of the biggest thus far, The <em>We</em> work company. The <em>We</em> Company has <em>raised</em> a total of $12.8B in <em>funding</em> over 14 round, now valued at $47 billion.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Fashion found its place in this universe. Little by little and without hurry, the fashionable Co-Working began to appear to unite all the roles that are within this world. A very good example is Moda Co-Working in Madrid. Fashion co-working is a space dedicated to a fashion lover can develop as a professional. The physical space has tables so you can locate your computer and work on your project. It has an atelier where designers have flat machines, sergers, cutting table, racks and everything they need to start or develop their clothing line. They have a photography studio where you can make photo productions with a model or make a product photo. In short, it is a space for fans of  fashion. The key to the success of this work is that it is not only a space to develop but also provide courses so you can continue training and advising on your project. The idea of fashion co-working is a brilliant one since you can find many people who can contribute to one main project.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">If you are a fashion designer you can find various resources like photographers, models, or a graphic designer to design your brand logo. Specifically, the goal is to know how to connect between people and get the best out of each one and add another. Like <a href="https://www.ifashionnetwork.com/fashion-revolution-what-does-this-really-mean/">Fashion Revolution</a>, the idea of the whole thing is to unify human visions.

Since we have memory, fashion is a brand for the great. Since the twentieth century, when Paul Poiret released the woman from the corset. In 1910 the skirt was what was used, in the 30 ´ the cut to the bias, in 1950 the "New look" was the last in fashion and a great trend in the decade. The mini skirt of Mary Quant in the \'60s. The leggings in 1980 and finally the minimalism in the 90 \'. Years of trends marked and respected by society. If you did not follow her, you were totally out of the fashion circle.

But, since 2000 that this "divide" for decades remained something, quite a bit, in the past. Since 2000, far from offering us novelties, fashion has in fact been retrospective and has brought about the return to previous decades.

The novelty vintage. What was used before, is the trend today. Is it like that? Today, the brands bring back the trends of the past but communicating this new generation.

A freer generation, without fears, breaking structures but even so, although some deny them, we continue to respect what the big brand tells us what to use, and how. But, what do we really want to do when we dress?

While it is clear that we can not walk around naked, it is illegal. The question really is, what do we want to do or express when we dress everyday? Follow trends? Search in the latest fashion magazines? Follow inspirations during fashion week or are we really trying  to communicate something, perhaps who we really are? There is a fine line between who we are and how we dress. There are many people who are what fashion says, they are the ones that trend brands, there are people who use trends to reinforce their personality. With which personality do you identify more?

We know that our past was shaped by marked and respected trends. Fashion is what it is for those  who creates it. The designers, producers and style icons who are simply inspired to create through their imaginations. But today, in 2019 many things changed. The tendencies that are established today are those that at some point had already been indicted but with another perfective, another design and clearly another morphology. A more current to the new generation. Freeride.

Today, we accept the trends that identify us to who we are. We are in a new era where people struggle to be strong in their opinions and visions of seeing life. And this clearly reflects in todays fashion. Fashion helps us to empower ourselves, give us tools to confirm who we are thanks to certain guidelines or characteristics of the trends we use at the moment. But, we do not choose them as society dictates, but we choose them for ourselves, to help us feel,  and /or  to make us stronger when it comes to communicating who we are.  Nothing is better than using clothes by means of fashion to express it. By this means,  fashion and its trends empower people, more specifically women.

Contemporary fashion distanced a lot from the trends. Now trends are part of the world apart and people are deciding whether to adapt to them or not and if they do, how well does it fit with their personality. Fashion as we know it today is free in form. The structures destroyed by the personalities that seek to reinforce their values and beliefs through the garments, they use everyday to show the world who they are.

Nonetheless, we have to thank the past decades for the creativity and all those who left us the ideas and inspirations we build on today. Brilliant minds of the past deserves most of the credit for laying the foundation, something we as a society now continues to builds on, but, in our own different ways.

Not only is fashion for the showing or for the season but it has become the most predominant way we communicate. Fashion is used in all aspects of life and have revolutionize the way express how we feel. Be it going out for dinner, church, work, party, work or part of a political activism.  We use fashion to strengthen ourselves as people, to express and reinforce our personality, our ideas and our way of living, being. So the next time you dress up, become more self aware, know that you are always communicating with others.

To begin with a bit of history, we should remember that before what we now know as "parade" or "catwalk/runway" was simply a moment. Where the designer showed him through a "model" a piece that he was doing to a lady of high society for your next event.
That\'s how it all really started. But it was the visionary Charles Frederick Worth, who with his creativity and ingenuity transformed this event into something a little more modern for the time.

Before, the pieces were created based on what the client wanted. It was created special and specifically according to your tastes. Worth completely changed this system.
Charles started creating his own pieces. Something super novel for the moment. He was the one who wholly chose everything. Details, morphologies, and fabrics. They were unique pieces and created especially from their ideas. The models of the moment were named as sosies and they were the ones who show the clothes and, walking in a straight line. Very similar to the present, since nowadays we have theatrical catwalks, like those of McQueen and Galliano in the 90s, The first fashion shows are related to the theater, and were created at the same time as the cinema.

<h3>Each designer had a proposal that identified them within the market, strengthened their identity within the world of fashion and above all, it was always something new.</h3>
Pretty soon, the beautiful Coco Chanel appeared who proposed to her models a certain position to mark her own style. Later, it would become a symbol of the brand itself. Everything was novel, ingenious, creative and broad strokes, a novelty. This was incredible and every time it became more theatrical. The press praises with participating and being inside each parade, of each season presentation because they knew that what was presented was something unique.
The 80 \'arrived and along with the Azzedin Alaia and his body suits giving a name to the "body conscious". Martin Margiela and his confusion because of the design and everything involved. He broke with the use of interviews, photographs, and parades to show his work, instead, he opted for the use of simple videos without music or set design.

After we went through Antonio Berardi, who worked for John Galliano, and was the creator shoes without heels in the back. Together with Alexander McQueen, John Galliano and Hussein Chalayan, he is considered one of the best designers of the 90s. Incredible, magnificent, admirable, visionaries, excellent designers.  One amongst all that still stands tall is McQueen. A great creator of  exceptional and spectacular art of wears. The moments of not only talking about clothes but also, of the magnificent parades. His was empowering women, giving them courage, strength, feeling, that people, he created magic on the catwalk.  How can one forget the memorable hologram he made with Kate Moss in 2006.

<h3>We had a great tour. The fashion world evolved together and thanks to all its designers that make every garment and every event possible.</h3>
Today, after having spent the 90\'s at the minimal of 2000, we can say that we have a little bit of everything. One of the best brands that will never stop surprising us with its staging is Chanel.  Each season offers us an imaginary world composed of art and unthinkable morphologies that only Karl Lagerfeld\'s could create.

Big brands continue to give us impressive catwalks, with art, an impressive scenography and other brands that are a bit calmer and well traditional. Today, in 2019, the multiplicity of designers and their ideas are millions and the trajectory simplifies it. We have gone from the simplest to the most insane, everything is valid in the eye of its beholder. Fashion has evolved in many forms but one thing for certain it has become the most expressive wearable art ever created.

In the August of 2018 Riccardo Tisci, the chief creative officer of Burberry, revealed a brand new logo and the TB Monogram print for the brand of Burberry. It is a nod to the creator of the brand, Thomas Burberry.
<blockquote>"When I first started at Burberry, I spent a lot of time in the archives researching the rich history of the house. I quickly became very interested in Thomas Burberry and who he was not only as an inventor and innovator, but also who he was as a man, a husband and a father. When I saw an image of his initials, the design felt so special and actually very modern, so I quickly developed it into a new code for the house. It’s a symbol that not only embraces Burberry’s heritage but also feels very contemporary."</blockquote>
This is the first time in 20 years that the luxury brand as changed deviated itself from its signature print.

To launch this debut collection with the monogram print, Tisci got Gigi Hadid to star for the campaign after she did her runaway debut for the brand\'s fall collection in 2019. She portrays four characters morphing into "the boy", "the gentleman", "the girl" and "the lady", the four distinct characters celebrated by the fashion house. She says in an interview,
<blockquote>“I have always loved and respected Riccardo’s work, and I feel so honored and grateful that he trusted me with this project.”</blockquote>
My first Burberry show was my first time working with Riccardo, and the timing just felt perfect. It gave us our first opportunity to really get to know each other. The second I heard the creatives for this shoot, I understood how I wanted to bring that to life and show different sides of myself through each character.” Hadid is photographed wearing an array of different pieces from bomber jackets to caps to trainer to tote bags.

<span style="text-align: center;">Tisci hired British artist Peter Saville to design the monogram and the debut collection. Along with him he also Nick Knight to shoot the campaign, stylist Katy England, make-up artist Isamaya Ffrench, hair stylist Gary Gill for the campaign. The print was originally unveiled  in the colors of tan and orange, but for the debut collection the TB monogram print is cast in a neutral palette of chocolate brown, chestnut brown, beige, with red stripes laid on top of the print. </span>
<blockquote><span style="text-align: center;">"It’s a symbol that not only embraces Burberry’s heritage but also feels very contemporary. What I wanted to do with the collection was to celebrate the breadth of who we speak to as a brand,"said Tisci.</span></blockquote>

Independent designers are those who seek to create, to express and be able to communicate a message. They are the ones who break all the structures, rules and stereotypes. They are those who create from the depths of creation and love of art. Leaving behind trends or any fashion that is established in society to set their own rules. Independent Designers, who, along with their creativity and devotion to art, their search focuses more on communicating the emotions and thoughts they want to communicate at the times they want. Most of them are timeless. They exhibit and launch when their collections are finished no matter what day or month of the year it is. They abide by no rules or corporate structures. The main purpose is to impose their ideas through clothing, expressing who they are, what the identity of their brand is, and what philosophy or manifesto they want to transmit through their creation.

They explore independence from conventional materials such as fabrics made in low-resource countries and create their own fabrics, building them based on their values.  Most create for various reasons, some  focus on creating to help the environment, creating sustainable materials and recyclables to support non-production mass and create unique and unrepeatable pieces. There are all kinds of freewheeling designers. An exceptional example is <a href="http://www.instagram.com/therapy_recyclexorcise_berlin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@therapy_recyclexorcise_berlin</a>. This brand was born between Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Berlin, Germany. The story is about two sisters who, with equal principles and ideas, created an apparel brand that would reflect their philosophy of life, creating fashion as they see it, while embracing all humans.

With its philosophy "Upcycling means upgrading" <a href="https://www.therapy-berlin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Therapy Recycle and Exorcise</a>  pursue to relocate fashion from an ethical and sustainable side. Establishing their own criterion that there is no such genre that can use their clothes, create unisex garments that were deconstructed and out of the ordinary. Recreating pieces of old clothes achieved, this brand is a clear example of what an independent designer follows to create in the world of fashion. Generating a rupture in the pattern and while at the same time uniting and developing a feeling of a union that we can all discover based on our feelings and beliefs.

While we are in a new generation of fashion where everything is possible and everything is attainable, big brands or commercial brands are governed by structures and investors, hence they create competing trends than the ideals and emotions of independent designers.  Therefore, the proposals of these creatives not only chase to sell a product but also go after making the person think what they will consume or  why they want to consume that brand. As a commercial brand, the primary goal is to focus on that which is trendy and to make the cash registers keep ringing in order to satisfy commercial objectives and the pressure of  board of directors and investors.
Albeit, an independent designer aims to make a financial success too, their heart and creative senses take lead in their decision making as such creating fashion art forms that expresses and communicate with their customers becomes their main objective while striving to balance the books and their financial objectives.

There are countless talented and aspiring fashion designers emerging from every corner of the world. While most lack financial assistants and exposure of their unique and unparalleled talents, they aren\'t giving up their dreams of becoming a household name anytime soon. Charitable and God sent organizations such as <a href="http://www.caafd.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Council of Aspiring American Fashion Designers (CAAFD)</a> brings opportunities to independent fashion designers that are just starting out. The  experienced team of leading industry professionals support the designers financially and through fashion parades and showcases during New York Fashion Week shows, also giving directions and guidance through the front door. While getting support through such organizations can sometimes come from luck and fortune stars, it is certain a combination of talent, persistency, building your brand and following the process can give you some merits of getting the much needed support.

On Thursday morning of the 29th of May,in a glossy shop in Marais - Paris, Pop star Rihanna quietly unveiled the debut collection from her new Fenty clothing line. The collection which was expected to be released with a loud bang, runaway shows and lots of editors and media was an intimidate affair.  “It’s definitely different from doing a show, with a show there are so many moving parts. That’s not to say it hasn’t been hectic, but there is something about the intimacy of doing things this way that I love,” Rihanna was quoted as saying.

With this unveiling, Rihanna made history twice over. This the first time the luxury group, LVMH  has launched a fashion brand from scratch since Christian Lacroix in 1987. Rihanna also became the first woman of colour to preside over an LVMH brand. She got a team of 12 designers for this brand. She also got on board Jahleel Weaver, a former stylist to serve as the brand\'s style director. She has decided to disregard the seasonal collections unlike traditional collections and brands and her collections with drop at surprising and frequent intervals.

The debut collection mostly consists of a  series of sharp-shouldered blazers which structured feminine curves which also happen to the back bone of the collection, poplin blouses with exaggerated shoulders and collars, wide-leg trousers and denim, series of Japanese denim jackets (a fabric Rihanna is partial towards) with cargo pockets and split flare pants, a signature corset blazer dress in exaggerated shoulders and fanny packs that doubled as waist-cinching sashes. Aptly titled "Release 5-19" for the month and year it will become available the collection is for bosses wanting to have some fun. With sizes going up to size 14, she is trying to break another stereotype with offering designer wear for plus size women. Since Rihanna body structure varies from time to time she has been testing the collection by trying it on herself first. "I’m a curvy girl, and if I can’t wear it myself, it’s not going to work," Rihanna told Vogue.

She has a huge fan following which helps her push this collection in the limelight. Her Instagram alone has a following on 71.2 million people. Rihanna made a guest appearance in the teaser video for Fenty\'s collection. She posted it on Instagram on Wednesday, a day before the unveiling. 2 million people had viewed it in a single day. If you happen to be in Paris, you can pop over to Marais and shop the collection. For others the collection goes live from 29th May. It ranges from $200 for a T-shirt and goes to around $1,500 for an outerwear.

In the middle of his adolescence, he was born in a community of like-minded free spirits, hippies.

He realizes how magazines used to reveal and give us access to some type of information you didn\'t get anywhere. Just like sex, fashion, music, and art. At this time TV was something more commercial. He noticed that Magazines were a symbol of freedom. With the time and experience this innovative artist, Oz, began to imagine a different universe to dispute to all those who were on the street and felt pols apart. He created an organic world in his mind where sex and fashion were the same things, where art was exciting and fashion was exquisiteness above all, and this journal would be the field for all those artists who could not show their art by the stereotypes that were noticeable in society.

So, the question is, what does this creative do, to bring fashion, sex, and art together?
A god of Freemind, Oliver Zahm could make sex look beyond what we all think when we hear or read the word sex. He is the one who creates a natural world where everything connects, where a magazine became a bible full of knowledge about all in all.

Purple Magazine is a masterpiece for collection, to conserve like a presided book of art. Where each page is an amazing experience, full of articles,  different and  grammage and texture of pages (this is not a common thing in a fashion magazine), where the main goal is to tell stories Every type of story, such as environmental, someone special in the art world, a new and exotic model, whatever. Intellectuals and curiosity artists, musicians, philosophers, and high fashion spreads through these pages.

<h3>Sex is something that as time goes by, it becomes more normal for us to hear or see. However, Purple Magazine transmits it from a place no more sophisticated, as it could have been playboy from a place of care, but from an exotic and erotic place at the same time, where they play many factors and tools that he himself acquired with the passage of time.</h3>
And clearly everything has begun since his perspective and vision towards fashion and nude as a form of art and how they all intertwine and complement each other.  Oz as a photographer is a sensor of erotic moments where fantasy and sexuality sink, creating fashion from visuals. It may sound strange, but it is what he really transmits when taking pictures. He transmits beauty, sensuality, and erotism all at the same time. His type of sex, "porn" (as some artists call his work as something vulgar) is elegant, delicate and fascinating. This is what makes Purple Magazine so special,  it\'s a space where one can find exquisiteness and class. His eyes are able to identify visuals that most creative people can not phantom. OZ this fashion, and rightly so.

It could be said that it is considered the "anti-glam", For those who take fashion as something traditional lifestyle such as the street style trends and catwalks.  For those who are a little more open for playing with the freedom of expression and the other interpretation or language of fashion, Oliver Zahm is the one who shows this path as something possible. We know that he speaks through his own vision and expresses it through his magazine.
Oz managed to turn his pages into a world for all those who are new, have a story to tell, who searched and found their passion. Purple Magazine is a magazine, which tells stories and well, most times through naked women.
<h3>As a photographer, he had the opportunity to photograph celebrities such as our loved and iconic Kate Moss.</h3>
[caption id="attachment_20196" align="alignnone" width="1000"]<img class="wp-image-20196 size-full" src="https://www.ifashionnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5-1000x736.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="736" /> Kate Moss by Oz at the Hemingway Bar, Ritz Hotel, Paris, 2008.[/caption]

Oz is one of the people who know the limits between a model and the forum. The works of his imaginations are visually strong. Women exposed 100%, but exposed to the confidence and the criterion of the photographer and that is noticeable. It shows in the expression of the model, in the posture and especially in the general photographic readings. The women of OZ are women of strong personalities, daring and playful. You can see that they live the way through imagination, creation and see art and fashion as a symbol of expression. And that is the very thing Purple Magazine seeks to transmit.

The reality is that, there are tons of criticism for his work from the conservative fashion traditionalist  who aren\'t very happy about how Oz has been exposing and naming fashion to nudes and situations in which the sexuality is implicit. Nonetheless, we are in an era where freedom of expression is encouraged, everything is allowed and what others think is something that can detract or reconstruct us, and that remains in us.
<blockquote>Oz, through Purple Magazine explains " I create a world where really for those who have the vision that everything can live together, where beauty is one and it is a matter of learning to read it."</blockquote>
If you are looking for space, a photographer, where the images express more than holdings or the typical fashions of the moment, check out the Purple Magazine. A magazine created to unify creators, photographers, fashion, sex, life stories and its culture.

Tisza uses molded pieces of silicon rubber as her fabric , a versatile material that supports her sci-fi ambience projects. The collection which contains mostly dresses and other outdoor pieces represent silicon in a glamorous  and glittery avatar.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Hungarian fashion designer established her company in 2012 and her main focus was women\'s swimwear. From 2014 she started experimenting with new technology and that is when she started using silicon rubber in her collection. Her collection is 100% waterproof, endurable and completely eco-friendly.  Tisza makes sure her that there is no wastage during the creative process and collection pieces are easy to clean requiring minimum water and chemical usage. For her Splash collection she had upgraded the technology by injecting water between layers of silicone to create the ‘Splash’ effect. With each and every collections she stretches her boundaries to lift silicone art to a new level just as she did with Possession.</p>
She has <span style="font-weight: 400;">designed on-stage bodysuits and dresses for Beyoncé and her dancers for her 2015 World Tour. Her designs have already been featured in British Vogue, Vogue China, Vogue Italia, Glamour UK and in almost all significant Hungarian fashion magazines.</span>

We are not talking about dressing up with fancy and expensive clothes, or second hand, we are talking about dressing in a way that our way of thinking, of expressing, our personality is reflected in each garment or accessories that we carry. Our way of dressing can talk about our profession, about our hobbies, about political ideologies, or if we are those addicted to fashion that follows each trend.

How many times do we find ourselves with certain discomforts with some garments that do not fit in our body, that we feel uncomfortable when we wear them. And here is when we ask ourselves, Why My Body, And Not Hers?
<h5 style="text-align: center;">The clothes speak, and much more than we think.</h5>

To be a little more specific, the parts of the body that most identify us and matter when buying clothes are Shoulders, Bust, Waist, Hip. These four parts of our body are going to help us to know WHAT TYPE OF BODY WE HAVE, and why we wear that dress well and  not at all. We have five types of female morphology types of body and their main characteristics and to give you a clearer example, we will put a celebrity as an example for each one.
<h2><strong>Body Rectangle:</strong> Well-proportioned shoulders and hips, at the same height, but lack waist. The example we are going to give is that of Gigi Hadid. With this image, what we show, reinforces her waist with some ties to mark it and that stands out inside her body.</h2>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hourglass:</strong> Shoulders and hips of the same width, have a well-marked waist. The clearest example is that of Kim Kardashian who dazzles us with her perfect silhouette.</h2>

This is not an article to show you what kind of bodies celebrities have. This is the moment when you  run to the mirror - preferably naked - and have an eye to see which silhouette fits with our body.
The main idea is that we can see that we all have different bodies and that our challenge is to be able to be those women, strong, independent, before a society that imposes,  knowing who we are outside and inside.
Knowing our strengths and weaknesses is what makes us the women we want to be. Therefore, with this article, we show you that each woman is different. That each one has an attribute that differentiates it from the other and that thanks to that attribute (we must always see everything positive) we can be who we want to be if we know how to identify it and empower it.

As we showed in the pictures of the celebrities, each one opted for a wardrobe that favors they taking into account their body\'s morphology. No morphology is better or worse than the other. Women just have to understand what kind of body they have, accept ourselves as we are and identify what garments are those that will make us highlight and embrace our curves.

Fast forward a few months, and once can see two different series of photo shoots launched in the month of April and May for its Pre- fall\'19 collection. For the April series of photo shoot, we see Michele\'s homage to the ancient Greek culture. Shot by Glen Luchford at the background of the temples of the Selinute Archaeological Park in Sicily, the series takes us back to the time when people would gather after banquets to chat, dance, mingle and have fun. Giving this banquet a modern twist, Michele brought hardcore punks, body builders, roller bladders and surfers dressed in brightly patterned Gucci wear to reignite that spirit for their Pre-Fall 2019 campaign.

At the mere age of 19, her work was both bizarre and though provoking. Her collection was titled "Places I\'ve Been Touched." She collected stories of sexual assault and incorporated them through text based prints, silhouettes and fabric choices. Every piece from the collection was accompanied by a mouthpiece. She wanted to send across a message that no matter what you wear, who you are or wear you are - no one is completely safe from sexual assault. With this collection, Evans hoped to spark a conversation, to get people discussing about this social issue.

Imogen Evans was born in London, moved to Edinburgh as a child and studied Fashion Design in Milan. ‘imi’ by Imogen Evans is a brand that utilizes fashion to address societal issues. Each collection captures a twist of our existence and rejects the idea of traditional colors, and shapes. Evans’s work creates a balance between art on the body and wearable, yet alternative clothing. She has a desire to create something, new, thought provoking and bizarre.

It is expensive yet affordable. This year the brand has consciously decided to change its vibe and bring along a more metropolitan feel.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4 class="desktop" style="text-align: center;"> “It’s a bit more tailoring this season, but with a Self-Portrait twist. It’s still fun but I wanted to have those pieces which are a bit more classy,”  said Han Chong backstage after the show.</h4>
</blockquote>
The show was opened by Hanne Gaby Odiele —a top model, a street style star, an advocate of the intersex community. Odiele opening the collection proved the efforts Self-Portrait is making to make themselves look more sharper, urban and versatile. The collection had a range of black and white silhouettes along with a palette of reds and navy blue. The collection spread across midi dresses and off-the-shoulder frocks, taffeta jumpsuits, coats and tuxedo inspired suits.

Scott whose creations are mostly fun and over the top left people in the audience gasping as he presented this year\'s collection. His theme this year was News. Fake News. Clickbait. He was not trying to comment on today\'s media but rather the notion on how one forms opinions on news without even reading the full story. Scott teamed up with artist Aleksandra Mir to hand-draw "fake news" headlines on an elevated range of clothing to express his viewpoint.
<blockquote>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">“This is my commentary on where we are as a culture,” Scott said backstage. “We as a people have an obsession for salacious headlines and clickbait. I took all that…garbage…and tried to make something beautiful,” he explained. It’s not the media itself so much as the mass audience’s appetite for destruction that is the issue: “It’s how quickly it can travel, change people’s reality and get them riled up instead of having understanding and compassion.”</h4>
</blockquote>
The collection was all in color of newspaper print black and white (except a few denim pieces in faded blue). Except these words, headlines from the Post and New York Daily News were hand written and designed by the talented duo on  biker jackets, puffers, party tutu dresses , denim and layered chiffon gowns.

The London born designer took inspiration from twenties designer Paul Poiret, his draping style and his famous Japanese-inspired silhouettes. The collection also drew inspiration from the simplistic elegance and asymmetry of Ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arrangement  and the geometric folds found in “Shadowplay,” a series by Dutch artist, Nicola Kloosterman.

The palette for this collection was that of deep purple, navy, and burgundy - a complete ode to Poiret, along with the use of bright lavender and metallic\'s. Plush velvet\'s and fluid silks were used for slip dresses and draped frocks.Suits  in modern shapes and tailored jackets with flared pants and fur coats rounded up the collection. The work was of intricate embroideries and refined prints. Giving a glimpse of traditional Japanese wood-blocking, Cushnie used both geometric and floral designs in her collection.

This year Badgley Mischka decided to take inspiration from the post World War II era of 40\'s and 50\'s. Vintage Mercedes-Benz sports cars were used as inspiration for the palette selection. Even though the colors were neutral, the fashion did not disappoint. Neither did the footwear!

Retro elements could be seen in voluminous sleeves and large bow accents. Plunging V-necklines with glittering jewelry for dresses and gowns along with some stunning  peep and pointy -toe pumps brought the old school glamour back. Sharp silhouettes brought elegance to the whole collection. Exquisite evening suits rounded up the collection. The whole collection was adorned with luxurious shades of gold,rose, jade, amber, opal and shimmering black. The closing finale was when all the models walked back on the stage all dressed in red but in separate designs and styles. The duo set up the right tone for the holiday season or maybe even the red carpet.

Pamella Roland knows exactly what her customers wants and she has decided to stick to that formula. This year\'s inspiration was Tiffany glass and stained glass window. "Window-like linear techniques are used throughout the collection, along with blending shades of bold and muted colors to represent the Opalescent technique used in Tiffany stained glass," Roland was quoted as saying.

The collection had 35 pieces in total and included body-hugging silhouettes to princess-style dresses and sparkling, glittering gowns to a few pieces of jumpsuits. She worked with beads, crystals, pearls and added feathers this season as per the customer demands. The whole collection was overall very pretty.

With a career spanning over three decade and across various designer houses, this years collection saw Ford bring back elements for the 90\'s in his collection along with nods to his collections from the house of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent from when he was associated with them.

This season\'s palette ranged from soft pinks, blues, grays and flesh tones, along with shots of deep burgundy and men’s wear in grays and blacks. There were a lot of  silk blouses worn wide open; roomy, satin pleated relaxed trousers; blazers and tuxedo jackets, fur coats and slouchy bomber jackets. Simple and elegant evening gowns featured caped backs, cut-outs and heavy chain hardware and full fur fedoras. Snug knits or hooded sweatshirts were paired with blazers, furs, trench coats and pencil skirts instead of button-downs.

He carried monk robes for inspiration on his last trip to Shanghai. The way monks dress and carry their robes differ from place to place and it was evident in the draping\'s around the shoulders and body.

The collection was that of regal and exquisite evening gowns. The designer used silk, crushed velvet and tulle in gorgeous colors for the collection. There was intricate lace and floral work in the gowns which was showed fine detailing and craftsmanship by the designer. The collection was also refreshing in the sense that it was limited to the stereotype sizes of the run away. Shoji used models of different size to showcase his collection which got him an additional nod from the critics and audience alike.

</em></strong>
AS: I\'m a haute couture designer. Born in Venezuela, settled in Barcelona. On the other hand, I began my first steps in the world of sewing and fashion from childhood to my grandmother sewing and being a model in my country of origin. When I moved to the Basque country, I started my studies in Production Programming in Mechanical Manufacturing. Professionally, I have worked for more than 4 years in a company, in the automotive and aeronautical sector.  My focus was the machine center with numerical control, where I developed multiple pieces for dying, which eventually will go out to the automotive and aeronautical sector, etc. Alongside this work, I studied at the only haute couture school in Spain, with the help of great masters such as the dressmaker Javier Barroeta, the teacher, Jeweler Bordador, Johan Luc Katt, and the Designer of Costumes and Haute Couture Costumes Angel Amor, among other great eminences.

  array('post_name' => 'victoria-ceron-wasted-clothes-transformed-into-beautiful-fabrics','post_title' => 'Victoria Cerón: Wasted Clothes Transformed into Beautiful Fabrics','post_content' => 'Meet Victoria Cerón Galdámez (28), a Chilean who through her university graduate thesis titled "<em><a href="http://www.instagram.com/telare.cl">Telare</a></em>" (meaning "Restorer Of Textile Garbage") discovered her path to building a sustainable fashion brand. During her final and iconic days as a graphic design student at the <em>Universidad Santo Tomás (CL), </em>she started a big journey in the world of costume design through the objective of her degree thesis which eventually turned out to be what is known generally as the "<em>Telare</em> Project." She found an idea and built a brand around it. She focused, creatively fusing discarded fabric weaving looms into beautiful fabrics to make elegant garments. She didn\'t just focus on garments, but she expanded her scope to implement this yet seen [then] creatively into making handbags, blankets, sofa pillow covers, and so on. As boundless as creativity can be, she had eyes on more fashionable things like other clothing accessories to make sure that her brand covers different areas of fashion soon; from simple dresses to stunning jackets.

Her designs were exhibited at a contest in Madrid after her graduation -thanks to her a teacher who made this happen. Her designs earned a second place position in the wardrobe category of the prestigious Madrid contest. What a great start for such an innovation. With all her nerves grinning with enthusiasm, Victoria began to sort ways of bringing her brand to the knowledge of the broader public.

Now you may ask; what does <em>Telare</em> do? And what is its elaboration process? This brand has been included mainly for its ideology and philosophy: recycling and sustainability. One of the most crucial questions for Victoria was what humans could do from their positions in society to take care of their immediate environment?" She has found her answer.

<em><a href="http://www.instagram.com/telare.cl">Telare</a> </em>is what it had to be, a new way of seeing the "garbage of fashion." From contests and music festivals such as Lollapalooza, <em>Telare</em> began to be presented as a brand and not as Victoria Cerón. The first real and concise production of <em>Telare</em> was made for Lollapalooza, Chile, where the interior billiards were lined with packing tape (disposable material) and the exterior with fabric. Within days, the fabrics were sold.

Soon enough, she went on to make wallets, and the idea of wallets turned to be a successful one. <em><a href="http://www.instagram.com/telare.cl">Telare</a> </em>soon began to reinforce its central ideology: "TO RECYCLE."

It was so in that same event, the Lollapalooza, that two containers were strategically positioned for people to leave clothing items that were useless to them and were willing to dispose of. Later, <em>Telare</em> would regenerate something new with all the clothing materials left.  That was a smart way to generate resources — an important method of contributing to the building a sustainable new world.

In no time, people began to find meaning in the project and began to donate a lot of clothes that they found useless. These materials, which were previously hilarious garments, were used for weaving and producing new, and even better artifacts.

In <a href="http://www.instagram.com/telare.cl"><em>Telare</em>,</a> the development process consists of four cyclic steps: The fabrics are manually cut stripe-like forms, looms are cut in lengths that fit the size of the expected product (the type of loom vary depending on the product in mind), a warp is made, and knitting is done one step at a time. The first outcomes of this act, just like every other first product, were untidy and unprofessional, but as Victoria perfected her craft, she found a way to make them look more attractive and perfectly fitting into different fabrics irrespective of the original make and style. This technology applied by Victoria for <a href="http://www.instagram.com/telare.cl">Telare</a> making is called "the Maple Map Technique," a peculiar attribute of Latin American history.

The purpose of this project is that there is no type of fabric decay. Thus, every fabric can be recycled, and every square inch is used to make even more beautiful products. For this reason, Victoria created a union between the threads of fabric such that every strand was a part of the new masterpiece.

As an entrepreneur, creating the <em>Telare</em> brand was an experiment to Victoria. Each new fabric that appeared within the options was a new challenge. For her, it was a fabric to loom and create a piece of cushion, a blanket, or a purse. After several years of commitment and experience working with patterned fabrics, <em>Telare</em> had its explosive moment. From interviews to conferences, the world of <em>Telare</em> and its vision towards recycling fabrics entered the world of sustainability. Interests geared up within the fashion industry as major brands grew interested in the new fashion style brand. Soon enough, these leading brands found a use for waste fabrics as they made contact with the <em>Telare</em> brand to help recycle them into better products.

<em>Telare</em> proposed two ways to participate with the brand: privately, giving individuals the chance of investing their clothes into the project. Victoria would transform their clothes into a piece of new woven product, and the person kept the resulting product. In this case, the owner of the fabric will pay for Victoria\'s effort and time. The second way was through \'marks,\' where big brands gave Victoria disposable fabrics which she used to generate products as a capsule collection for the brand itself. An obvious example is that of the capsule collection that he made with the brand <a href="http://www.instagram.com/domingoesdomingo">@domingoesdomingo,</a> where the designer, Agustina Alvez, gave her all the fabric delays that had discarded. Victoria created new products for <em>Domingo es Domingo</em>. And that\'s how a new mini-collection was created between <em>Domingo es Domingo</em> and <em>Telare</em>. These two are the clearest examples of <em>Telare\'s</em> primary objectives. Whether you are an individual or a brand, Victoria seeks to make people aware that nothing is lost and everything can be made into something new.

Over the years, she began to transmit this new way of recycling garments <span>for </span>people who were interested in the loom and in building a new world of sustainable fabrics.

In these six years, she visited countries, including Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, inspiring and teaching about her project. Years after, she held his first fashion show in Chile, where she made all dresses, bags, and clothes of different strokes and types of texture for the runway models, all done with discards.

Awesome, what do you think? Everything is used, and there was not a piece of cloth that was discarded. Today, the two objectives of this project; sustainability and recycling are still valid.
The project has been working for individuals, who want to transform their old garments into backpacks, or bed blankets and also with clothing brands to create capsule collections with the delays of producing fabrics. Victoria is a creator, a visionary, and above all, an entrepreneur with concern for her immediate environment.

<h4 style="text-align: left;">"I think this concept is very important. I am trying to convey what it is, to take charge of our textile waste. To be aware of what we are buying, and what we do when we no longer use it. The same with brands, what are brands doing with their textile garbage? All those pieces of cloth that no longer serve you. Where are you going? We must begin to visualize what is happening."

Hanako Maeda took inspiration from the north most islands of Japan, Hokkaido and its native Ainu population.  The population has stayed away from technology and lives in harmony with the environment and nature. The earthy colors used by the population in their garments made with natural dyes of plants and flowers - turmeric yellow, poppy red, cacao brown, fuchsia along with shades of blue formed the basic for the vibrant palette for Adeam\'s showcasing.

Ainu’s embroideries and geometric patters were artistically incorporated in the whole collection. The collection ranged had bomber jackets, silk frocks, wrap and maxi skirts. Gowns with two-tones closed her showcasing.  Maeda also used, eco leather in her collection to strive a balance with nature and fashion. Each piece of work had embroideries from the Ainu tribe and use of ribbons, laces and pleating to show a touch of handwork. The whole collection gave a very sleek and urban look and yet it showed a very personal and earthy aspect of modern fashion.

For the Fall/Winter\'19 Showcasing Simkhai decided to inspire himself from his maternal grandmother\'s Ukrainian lineage. Going through snapshots of the family and the traditional Ukrainian dresses, he realized that women of that era wore a scarf with just about anything and that is how he made scarf\'s the focal point of this collection.

He replaced lace with scarf in all his designs for this collection. The collection saw scarves in almost all the pieces with rich, intricate patterns at the start of the lineup to the stunning gold scarf dress that closed the show. Trying to give an urban and modern twist to the whole collection, the scarf prints were also seen on trench coats, printed puffer jackets, slip dresses and draped frocks.

Guests at Brandon Maxwell\'s Showcasing were in for a surprise. Gone was the extravaganza of last season. This season was all about returning to the fundamentals. Maxwell had been spending the past few months with his mother, Pam who was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after the Spring\'19 Runaway.
<blockquote>“In that time I developed a deeper appreciation for women who transform the ugliness and brutality of reality into something beautiful and substantial. I found myself thinking about the potential of clothes to act like armor against the elements both physical and spiritual,” Maxwell explained in his show notes.</blockquote>
<div class="card card-pull-center card-captioned collection-item">
<div class=" card-content ">The Fall\'19 Collection was quite demure with a palette of black and white with the occasional neon green, apple red and aqua popping up. Maxwell used silk and velvet to display his pieces. The collection displayed essential pieces like tailored trousers, pant  suits, Little Black Dresses upgraded to Luxe Elegance. The collection included several takes on tuxedo\'s with a black tuxedo displaying a cut-out sports bra and another piece in white displaying a puffer jacket instead of a blazer. His final piece of the evening was a parachute gown in vivid pink.</div>

Becket Fogg one of the founders of \'Area\' made the above statement to MSN lifestyle as Area presented their latest collection at the fall/winter\'19 showcasing at the <a href="http://nyfw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYFW</a>. He along with Piotrek Panszczyk started the fashion brand, Area in 2014 and have been working towards becoming the new generation of fashion since then.

For this collection, they turned the runaway set into a shopping hall at the exit of a metro station on Wall Street, in the south of Manhattan. The collection can be best described as eclectic glory. It was outrageously fun, sexy, feminine, quirky, and versatile. The collection ranged from power suits to ponchos and sweaters; from blazers with shorts to party dresses.
<p style="text-align: left;">"All our textiles are developed. We really like even all the crystal cage pieces, it\'s a puzzle, it was a mathematical puzzle of metal all connected and sorted together. The same as the knits, they\'re all hand done. Embellishment for us has always been quite like a strong starting point, but I feel like this collection especially, embellishment wasn\'t embellishment anymore it was almost a concept. It was a technique, it became really about building clothes with trims you know, and that\'s where it really, I don\'t know, we really challenged ourselves which was really nice," Piotrek Panszczyk told MSN Lifestyle.</p>

The Fall\'19 collection was titled \'Suitcases of the World\' to show the inspirations that he drew from his long travels to Nepal, India, and China. The collection picked elements from these South East Asian countries and blended then wonderfully into the American fashion style.

The palette was bright with loads of color, glittering jewelry, and footwear. The collection showed hand-loomed brocade patchwork fabrics collected from Varanasi, India; hand knit cashmere along with hand-painted motifs from Nepal. Landscapes of Taj Mahal and various other famous places from South East Asia were also on display. To add the American touch the collection also had a sport standard feel but the pieces were on the likes of quilted duvet coats, bombers, safari jackets, and cargo pants. Gurung drew inspiration from the 70\'s collection of Blass, YSL, and Lacroixisms. These were his idols in the fashion industry.

Gurung also teamed up with the Japanese jewelry house Tasaki, to present beautiful pieces of jewelry highlighting pearls. The designer is known for his footwear collection and he did not disappoint this time either as he presented ankle booties, V-cut pumps, and a few block heels. The collection was fun and cheerful.

  array('post_name' => 'unfashionable-fashion-styles-aim-to-manifest','post_title' => 'Unfashionable Fashion Styles Aim to Manifest','post_content' => 'Remember that impactful and surprising collection of Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren  a few months ago? That was the beginning of a fashion manifestation, that, in an ironic way became a movement.

The movement continues to stomp on the catwalks, and they were the first to launch haute couture in a revolutionary and especially shocking way. We have seen spectacular events such as the Chanel shows and their amazing scenarios or the incredible details of Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen. Yet, there is nothing as "in your face" phrases and huge amounts of tulle, until now.

The total revolution on the messages about the social structures and the non-libertinism of the expression. These two designers managed to impact the world not only of haute couture fashion but also of the Pre-Ta-Porter since after what happened many brands began to create pieces with messages about different movements found from certain socialist points.

What was surprising was to transform into memes, and quickly became viral at the time. They made this humorous event, very characteristic of these designers, full of energy and with very few rules, they managed to transform this into a fashion where later, several brands would do the same, but clearly  Pre-Ta-Porter. Many brands start creating pieces to express what people thought and wanted to manifest. Some of these brands began to design their products based on what their consumers and their ideologies were based, and this is how many brands began to have stamped garments with political, ideological or social messages.

And what started as an haute couture game with unexpected and twisted messages, ended up being a push for many brands to decide to take control of their power to bring great messages to society on the runways. Nowadays There are many brands that choose for their ideologies and thoughts through the power of their brand. Somehow nowadays people seek to be heard. So, the world of fashion technology does not only sell products to dress people but also to manifest ideas, ironic or not, Designers know and are aware of the power they have to get certain messages to their followers and few of them use it. Today, the important thing is that fashion stopped being meant for sales but also is used to mobilize. Fashion has become the way to manifest.

The world of art, music, and film is a means to disseminate and reach those who can not have access to certain information to what is really happening on the planet. What some people take to be ironic and perhaps funny, helps others dare to raise their voices and communicate, through the power of "fame," what society is doing with people. It seeks to reach all people to enhance the development of women and society in general; so that the new generations could be more aware.

<h5>What is seen on the big catwalks, then generates a high impact on society? Each person takes strength to see those powerful designers with a lot of voice dare to break the rules. Thanks to them, many people today feel accompanied to do the same.
<strong>There are many movements that are created against certain aspects of society and today. Thanks to some brands, those movements have been heard.</strong></h5>

One of the most popular members is, of course, Kim Kardashian West. The 38-year-old reality TV queen is dubbed as beauty trendsetter every woman looks up to.

But, the chich lady still wants more than just fame and wealth; education. Yes, she thinks education is essential. Kim wants to be a lawyer, and she registered with the California State Bar last year to accomplish her dreams.

“Last year I registered with the California State Bar to study law. For the next 4 years, a minimum of 18 hours a week is required, I will take written and multiple choice tests monthly. As my first year is almost coming to an end I am preparing for the baby bar, a mini version of the bar, which is required when studying law this way,” she wrote in her Instagram post with a picture of herself studying with her attorney mentors, Jessica Jackson and Erin Haney.

People may frown their foreheads and underestimate the mom of three’s dream to have a career in the legal sector amid her and her family’s popularity. They think that Kim only cares about her looks. But she insists that nobody can stop her from pursuing her dream.

"I’ve seen some comments from people who are saying it’s my privilege or my money that got me here, but that’s not the case. One person actually said I should \'stay in my lane,\'" Kim wrote.

Kim has to stay away from her husband and three kids when she studies and does an assignment. In fact, the legal issue is no stranger to her as her late father, Robert Kardashian was the lawyer that defended former football star O.J Simpson who was charged with murder.

Also, Kim, who helped to set up a new health center in the name of her late father at UCLA, lobbied President Donald Trump to release Alice Marie Johnson, a woman who served 21-year-imprisonment for a non-violent drug charge. Kim met with Trump in 2018 to talk about the importance of prison reform.

The meeting with the POTUS helps the "Keeping Up With The Kardashians" star to realize that she needs to learn more about the law. Luckily, the requirements to become a lawyer in California are not that strict as the state is one of the states that allows a person to take a bar exam instead of studying at faculty of law for four years.

  array('post_name' => 'glitter-makeup-rules-in-coachella-2019','post_title' => 'Glitter Makeup Rules in Coachella 2019','post_content' => 'The Coachella Valley Music Festival is an annual music and arts festival held at Empire Polo Club, California. Various noted musicians and singers have performed at this event, from Pearl Jam to Arianna Grande to Beyonce as well as reunited groups. The attendance is always high. But the show offers more than just outstanding performances by your favorite musicians.

The Coachella Valley Music Festival is the place to see and to be seen. High-profiled celebrities want to show their best look and do more to their hair or make-up, and festival attendees love to follow suit.

Last year, we saw 90-influenced hairstyle with wet skin introduced by Queen Bay. Then, what are the trends in 2019?

Glitter makeup is gaining popularity as it works for all skin types. Festival-goers can put glitter, not on their eyelids. Interestingly, women do not only use glitter eyeshadows to look sparkling but also rhinestones, jewels to add a unique touch.

The best thing about glitter is that everyone can apply it, even beauty newbies. There is no right or wrong about this style. Glitter also offers happiness, as Global Beauty Director for YSL Beauty, Tom Pecheux said.

Pecheux told <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/coachella-makeup-looks-2019-glitter-rhinestones">Refinery29</a>: “I really love glitter because it makes you think of joy and happiness.”

You can be creative with your glitter without overdoing your makeup as Pecheux recommended. Coachella visitors tend to add glitter on eyelids, cheekbones, and inner corner. Do you want to sparkle your look? Here are some tips:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Choose one glitter that suits you:</strong> What kind of glitter do you want? If you want a natural one, choose a color that matches your skin tone and stick with that. If you overdo it, your look will be like a costume, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-wear-glitter-makeup_n_5c111a9fe4b0ac53717ab8bd">said Gloria Ellias-Foeillet</a>, a makeup artist who works with rapper Missy Elliott. Even though there are no fixed rules about glitter look, makeup artists recommend focussing on the eyes, as Morgane Martini, makeup artist for model Ashley Graham stated.</li>
 	<li><strong>Use it appropriately:</strong> Balance is essential, especially if you want to apply glitter in more than one area. For example, if you have a bold glitter on your eyelids, try to soften on your cheekbones.</li>
 	<li><strong>Apply sparkly look on your eyes first before everything else:</strong> It can help you save time and most makeup experts recommend this method.</li>
 	<li><strong>Use a cosmetic glue, but be careful with your eyes</strong>: If you want to have a long-lasting look, you can apply your glitter with a cosmetic glue. But avoid your waterline when using your glitter.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>“The eyes are very sensitive, and if it’s not cosmetic glitter, it can be dangerous to apply them in your eyes,” Martini said.</em></h3>

The Japanese tidying expert advises that anything that doesn\'t "spark joy" should be let go and based on this Lim has made a no-nonsense collection for Fall\'19.
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>“This season I wasn’t thinking about a theme. I really wanted to create a wardrobe instead and find sturdiness and reliability in a moment when the world too often feels chaotic.”</em></h3>
</blockquote>
Lin has partnered with Woolmark Co. to use natural and recycled fibers for 60% of her collection. He has also stopped using exotic skins and fur from this season. “We’ve always been pretty sustainable, frugal and practical, but we decided to do it with more intention and purpose, It’s about doing small things to add up to an adjusted culture,” Lin said.

What came out as a result was a sturdy-chic line of pieces. The palette went back to the basic of black, blue, olive and white. Sturdy trench coats, wool capes, cocoon coats and sweaters, jackets and blouse tops made for the upper half of the collection. For the lower half, the collection had some wide options in the form of trousers, cargo pants, long and sweeping skirts.

The runway balanced the spy attire from the World War II era and the modern era. The runway was lit with berets and trench coats and wide belts dominated the collection. Other than that, bomber jackets, pointy dresses, wrap skirts, high waisted trousers brought the spy attire to the modern era. It also gave the collection a boho romantic touch, something which the brand is known for. The Billowy blouses and sweaters did look out of place but did fall in place as a winter showcase piece.

The pieces were styled in mug shot prints of tartans and leopard, and varied patterns in versatile colors. Other than that the collection had short plaid dresses and gowns with slits cut sky-high. Men were also dressed in smart candy-colored sweats and cardigans.

The set up was of a bare concrete industrial space, with a scenic view of the Hudson River and the skyline surrounding it. The designer duo is known for experimenting and redefining to put refinement to their collections.

This collection showcased the use of denim, leather and androgynous suiting styled in a clean and clear way. Most of the pieces seemed gender neutral. The highlight of the collection was the various kinds of trench coats the designer duo showcased on the runaway. The jackets and coat displayed multiple panels. The dresses gave a utilitarian feel. The brand is known for some stunning pieces of accessories and they did not disappoint this time either. The square-toed, angular cut boots were the most highlighted accessory. Other than they had a wide array of handbags from the metal rings tote bags to the long chained strap compact purse. In their press notes, Jack McColloug and Lazaro Hernandez said:
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>“Continuing to clearly define and refine the Proenza Schouler woman is at the core of the fall 2019 collection.Pieces are created as remnants of things that once were, thus calling on one’s memory to complete the composition.”</em></h3>

Growing up in Detroit served as the background for this collection. Growing up in the Detroit area, she was too young to get into the Grande Ballroom, so she befriended a senior to collect show bills designed by Carl Lundgren and Gary Grimshaw for her. The background of the runaway had six posters depicting art from the \'60s pop culture.

The collection drew heavily from the works of Gary Grimsham, Victor Moscoso, Milton Glaser, Carl Lundgren, David Palladini, Mary Blair and David Weidman. Colors were an important part of Sui\'s collection. Every model was vibrant and popped up from head to toe. Bright colored wigs adored almost all model\'s head. They were inspired by Anna Karina’s wedding day bouffant. The pieces from the collection were as eccentric as they were refreshing. Short dresses, faux fur coats, knitted cardigans, granny dresses, brocade suits, jackets, frocks and jumpsuits dominated the collection.

Titled, "School Daze," the collection as described by Glemaud showed what people would like to wear after summer vacation. The range was all knit but showed diversity in techniques.

Portrait of trans actress Indy Moore hung around the Spring Studio where the designer presented his collection. Glemaud said he found an instant connection with Moore when he met her for the first time and really wanted to work with her for a while. Moore was seen having a gala time in and around the Lowell Hotel in Manhattan. Her portraits depicted a joyous, carefree Moore as she danced in Central Park. The collection showed one-pieces, cardigans, jackets, tops and jumpsuits in various materials and knits. "Fierce Fall Fashion," is what Glemaud called it.

The ball started rolling when they visited Dubai last year. They chose to show a mix of cultures from Morocco and Spain for the Fall\'19 Showcasing. But they chose Grand Mosque of Córdoba in Andalusia, Southern Spain as the main focal point for their collection this year. Layers of both Islamic and Christian could be very well seen in the pieces Kim and Gracia designed and presented. Motifs in rich earthy hues formed the palette for the pieces of Oscar de la Renta.

The show opening piece was what has most of the times been an Oscar de la Renta\'s piece - a suit but it had a twist to it. Instead of picking a proper ladies suit, this piece had glen plaids over black pants. Antique carpentry inspired pieces were another highlight for the collection. The collection was not dominated for the gowns Oscar de la Renta has been so famous for except for the closing. Bella Hadid closed the show in a black velvet gown adorned with Islamic decorations as a nod to the Islamic Culture in grand proportions.

What Lee left us.','post_content' => 'We were in the \'90s, and the fashion boom was extroverted. Characters like Gianni Versace were those who had conquered the catwalk in recent years. Others like Martin Margiela reigned in the novelty, but, it was Lee Alexander McQueen, a British genius, who taught us how to empower women through garments. A genius like him, born knowing what he is about to create. At only 16 years, Lee already had a vision of fashion; not only different but also with an extremely extroverted objective. With a bold and theatrical style, McQueen was characterized by having a clear message: that the woman feels safe not only for who she is but for the clothes she is wearing. Give voice to the woman through details, volume, prints, and flown.

<h4>McQueen graduated from Saint Martins College of Art &amp; Design and received his master\'s degree in fashion design in 1992.</h4>
After several creations as an independent designer, McQueen was named Chief Designer of Louis Vuitton-owned Givenchy. But it was clear that McQueen was a creative genius that was going to break all the expectations and beliefs of the current fashion of the moment.
A designer like him was able to create pieces that only in dreams one could imagine, but no, McQueen could carry an idea and make it come true. But as we know, working for others was not their thing. Alexander McQueen was born to create his pieces and for the world to see what he was capable of. Novelty pieces are, little to say, what McQueen built were garments totally beyond the reach of the human mind, and very few marks were going to allow to break with the identity that they had been working.
<blockquote><strong> "I treated Givenchy badly. It was just money to me. But there was nothing I could do: the only way it would have worked would have been if they had allowed me to change the whole concept of the house, to give it a new identity, and they never wanted me to do that."</strong>
<strong>                                                                                                                                    Lee.</strong></blockquote>
His vision of fashion was beyond anything we could imagine at that time. His catwalks were more than selling trends, they were a piece of art in the middle of a scenario decorated as a theater. He couldn\'t think about fashion and not relate it to something extraordinary. It was something obvious that he would never had worked for other brands. Let\'s not forget that his first collection, for the university, was inspired by the character of Jack The Ripper. His mind was totally blinded because of his perception of women appearance. That pattern of the woman was not usual.
<h3>He creates a monster of fashion.</h3>
As we know he didn\'t believe in the commercial trends that the world was selling, he creates his own world, Leather tailoring, dresses with lace asymmetrical hello, extravagant hats created by Philip Treacy, feathers, embroidery, degraded prints and digital prints, different seasons, different inspirations, the same universe of creativity. A sensitive man, surrounded by ghosts and planes of darkness that made Alexander McQueen have the ability to imagine and visualize garments that nobody but he could create. Tormented and misunderstood, with a provocative and irreverent attitude towards the system, the genius transmitted those qualities when he took the needle and the scissors are unique in combining street feeling with the purest English baroque style.

His was not just concentrated in the clothes. Their catwalks were more than an ordinary event. From the clothes to the makeup, the hats, the sound, the setting everything had a meaning and a way to the dark message that McQueen wanted to convey. Let\'s not forget that this creative went beyond fashion itself. All his collections were based on moments of his life, stories, inspired by events, books, women, etc. All of his productions had something new, something different, something that no other designer had done or presented. One of the most outstanding and unforgettable fashion shows of this designer was that of Paris Fashion Week Fall 2006. Kate Moss appeared on the catwalk through a Hologram. Awesome! We can not forget this event since it was something totally shocking for the world of fashion and catwalks.

<h3>While today the brand is very well represented by a creative and great friend of the designer, Sarah Burton, the real question is, What has Alexander McQueen left us?</h3>
Today the brand is rather a commercial descent of the great ideas and innovative ideas of Lee. Alexander McQueen began by representing the total freedom of expression in many of the aspects that today we are discussing in society. Brimming with powerful modernity, this provocative artist reflected his fascination with beauty and the natural world.
Under all that aura of wild sensations that surrounds his creations, resides his uniqueness and bizarre talent so far. Quality clothing as the basis of their collections. Together with the impressive narrative capacity, are responsible for a large part of their international prestige.

His focus and he remains one of the brands, was to modify and embellish the female silhouette. McQueen was always in another dimension when it was related to fashion. He based his creations with a high level of craftsmanship and great tailoring techniques. Exquisite workmanship and an expert cut supported even the most extreme designs and the theatrical fashion shows. If an external appearance has a scaffolding of magnificent construction on which to lean. Even the most extravagant designs can be full of meaning.

Today we remember him as the creator of imperial haute couture, where details and luxury were based on dark ghosts from the same designer creating unique and unrepeatable pieces.

The whole stage was dark except for the runaway where focus lights were shone on the models walking and the quartet.
<h4 style="text-align: center;"> “Each look will be an exaggeration of our view of who each of the women is. For lack of a better word, it’s like a <em>cabin</em> of women we love.”</h4>
The palate was balanced with pops of bright color and muted tones.  The fabric used was mostly luxurious with a lot of feather looks.  The collection consisted of coats and capes, sweater and skirts and dresses. But the biggest surprise of the evening was when Marc Jacob brought back  Christy Turlington - the 90\'s supermodel to close the collection. Turlington who was last seen on the runway in \'94 was dressed in a black feathered dress and leather boots and looked like a black swan.

Ingo Wilts added a little flair of athleticism in the collection of suits and coats. The models were also spotted in pieces made of velvet, leather and luxe cashmere. The palette picked was true to colors of BOSS signature colors in shades of camel, grey, white and navy. But to balance out these shades, the collection also saw pop colors like cool yellow and hot pink. The collection was refreshingly simple with no glitz and glam but the simple art of tailoring speaking for itself.
<h4 style="text-align: center;">“The collection was built on our heritage of suits and tailoring, but it’s much softer and rounder. Fabrics have volume but they’re light and soft.  Last year’s men’s collection was “very constructed and utilitarian, but this is much softer,” Wilts said.</h4>

With a vibrant collection palette inspired by his birth country India, the collection saw lots of prints, textures, floral embroideries and beadings from the \'70s.&nbsp;“The Seventies. Mick Jagger, the Beatles going to India, I grew up in that era,” Khan said.

“I really designed everything as a layer, you can take pieces and mix and match. There are a lot of combinations to be had,” Khan said. There were a lot of vests, trousers, blouses, and jackets. There were also a couple of gowns and dresses. The collection also saw Khan taking inspiration from his mentor,&nbsp;Roy Halston. Khan was his apprentice in the \'70s. The draping and the figure-hugging silhouettes were all a nod to Halston, reminding him of the good old days. But he also tried bringing a balance here as he drew parallels in the social and political scenarios from today.

If all these were not enough to keep the crowds delighted, the ending made it more worthwhile. The finale saw the&nbsp;Halstonettes -&nbsp;Pat Cleveland, Alva Chinn, and Karen Bjornson walk down the runway&nbsp;dressed in head-to-toe sequined dresses. The trio were Roy Halston\'s muses back in the \'70s.&nbsp;"With a nod to Halston, my mentor, this is my take on fashion that today\'s woman can mix to make her own," Naeem Khan was quoted as saying.

The collection saw a lot of structured work, something which Mohapatra is also known for. With a colorful palette, embellishment and embroideries, the craftsmanship was beautifully done. The collection saw a lot of gowns, dresses, skirts, shirts. streamers and coats. Mohapatra also partnered with a leading jewelry brand in India to provide various pieces of diamond jewelry to go with the pieces adorned by models to give the whole collection a more authentic look.

This year the designer duo were inspired with the oversharing culture by influencers on social media. What came out of the "break the internet" theme was fun over the top collection in neon colors.

The collection was in continuity with his spring collection just with brighter shades and more options. It got a set of mix reactions from the audiences. A lot of day wear options were added this time. There were the trademark sweatshirts and the mini dresses were overlayed with rhinestones. The over jazzy neck pieces serves as straps for the gowns whereas wristwatches served as straps for the neon high heels. The collection was in sync with the theme, though there ere some pieces that failed to make the mark. But the question remains - how long can Christian Cowan continue along the same lines of pieces?

The collection had silhouettes from the \'70s and had a fun, flirty and retro vibe to it. Other than the knitwear, dresses and other pieces, Rowley also launched her new shoe collection with eyewear and jewelry collection said to be in the pipeline. The collection was a far cry from depicting just the winter or fall season as 12 models jumped right into the swimming pool dressed in wet suits for a final walk.
<blockquote>"Art is always an inspiration. I was thinking about the Warhol sunset series and how the sun is always rising and always setting somewhere in the world. I sometimes feel like we’re in a bubble in New York Fashion Week, and people think it’s Fall and we have to show wool, but there’s a blizzard here and 100 degrees in Australia, and we’re a global brand. The seasons don’t really matter, which is why I wanted to show wetsuits now." Cynthia Rowley told The Daily.</blockquote>

Jeans, slip dresses, sweaters and parkas dominated the runaway. There were also denim jackets paired with pants for men. The collection was overall ell received and reminded of the times when Lang held the reigns of the company in the 90\'s.

The collection depicted traits from the island and was both sensual and depicted a sense of freedom. The color palette was of turquoise, deep blue, delicate pink, whites, blacks and silver with a lot of sequence work. The collection comprised of gowns and dresses. The work was a combination of restraint and a little excess. The sequential gowns had mermaid-like feel whereas the white wedding dress was inclined towards the traditional Capri fishermen traditional dresses.  Scognamiglio tried showing the traditional culture of the island with a sense of freedom.

The designer plans on holding a special invite-only Maison Francesco Scognamiglio show for his VIP guests in the month of August as part of his plans to promote his beloved island of Capri and narrow the gap between the island and his fashion house.

In what seemed like a fitting homage to the creative director of 54 years to Fendi, the Fall 2019 Couture Collection was showcased in the Temple of Venus in Rome, a place Lagerfeld loved and the brand has underwritten to restore.
<p id="dek" class="desktop">Silvia Venturini Fendi, the now solo designer presented the collection in the backdrop of the majesty Roman Colosseum. The extravagant show was breathtaking, to say the least. The collection put up 54 pieces, the number of years Karl Lagerfeld had spent in the house of Fendi. Each piece took inspiration from Lagerfeld\'s tenure with the fashion house. Venturini Fendi spoke about how she had to hit the archives to get reference and inspiration for this collection. What turned out was a fuse of collections with a homage to Lagerfeld while the brand staying firmly rooted to ground with one foot and taking another foot into the unseen future.</p>
<p class="desktop">The late creative director not only changed the face of fashion and also what could come out of the House of Fendi but he also revolutionized the use of Fur in fashion. Keeping this in mind and also putting her own foot in the collection, Venturini Fendi used fur in a \'lighter and lighter" mode in the collection. The opening piece was a white wool suit with a white full sleeve jacket and white bootleg pants. The look inspired by Lagerfeld\'s time in the \'70s set the tone for the evening.

For the fall 2019 Couture Collection, Murad took inspiration from a recent trip to Morocco in North Africa. “Marrakech is a paradise; I fell in love. Such a cosmopolitan city. There’s so much heritage and tradition there, but it also has a modern vibe. It’s like Beirut but with a different style,” he said.

He took inspiration from everywhere he could find in North Africa: the tile work, the carpets textures, the tattoos of the local tribes, the floral and motifs, the prints and sequences. The color palette was a rich tone of purples, reds, greens, and gold. Black was another color used well by the designer. Blend this with a mix of Yves Saint Laurent from the \'70s and Voila!, the fall\'19 Collection was ready.

Headbands played an important accessory this fall. “I loved the idea to do this headband, it reminds me of Saint Laurent, of many celebrities from the Seventies, they used to put the headband with messy hair, it’s so cool, I think,” Murad said. The whole collection consisted of dresses and gowns which were red carpet ready wear. There were some richly colored jacquards and hand-beaded jackets thrown in the mix. The beaded work in the pieces was exquisite. The intricate detailing and the designing of every piece made us realize why Zuhair Murad needed two fully staffed ateliers to complete the pieces.

A favorite amongst the brides, Zuhair Murad is known for his custom bridal outfits. He did not disappoint the would-be brides this time either. His final piece was an ivory bridal gown with an abstract floral-carpet pattern in tonal crystals and sequins that could be any bride\'s dream gown. In his own words, Murad said that the gown was designed keeping in mind a real-life princess.

One of the forefront people to try and bring about a change in the fashion industry to embrace inclusivity and individualism, his Fall\'19 Collection did not disappoint at all. A-stars like Gwyneth Paltrow, Celine Dion, Nomi Campbell along with Valentino Garavani and Giancarlo Giammetti were in attendance to witness the spectacular collection.
<h4 style="text-align: center;">“The only way to make couture alive today is to embrace different women’s identities and cultures. It’s about the idea of individualism. It’s important today to dream of a world without boundaries, where everyone can live their own routes, everywhere. It’s just a dream, of course,” Piccioli said.</h4>
The designer chose a floral theme in a colorful palette to showcase through his couture pieces.  The Valentino Collection was also inspired by Avedon portraits, Guy Bourdin advertising shots, canvases by the Italian Renaissance mannerist Rosso Fiorentino, and paintings of Diana Vreeland’s documentary, The Eye Has To Travel. The collection had a total of 71 pieces with a focus both on day wear and evening wear.

The Couture Collection was worn by women of different races and age as they gracefully walked the runway to showcase them. For day wear  Piccioli showcased tops and culottes, waist length trousers with bustiers, colorful coats and draped dresses. The evening wear consisted of skirts, dresses, and ball gowns. The detailed handwork took hundreds of hours to complete.  “It’s not engineered by computer. You can feel the humanity in it,” Piccioli told Vogue.

In what was the most touching and teary-eyed moment of the entire show, Pierpaolo Piccioli brought the whole team behind the collection out on the runway to walk with him. The whole Atelier staff walked down the runway as a gesture by Piccioli to celebrate individualism and he thanked the team for making the collection possible. At the end of the runway, the whole team stopped to blow kisses and say thank you to Valentino, the man who created this fashion house.

  array('post_name' => 'fall-2019-couture-viktor-rolf','post_title' => 'Fall 2019 Couture: Viktor & Rolf','post_content' => '"Glamour" has always been associated with appeal and beauty.  For their Fall\'19 Couture Collection,  designer duo Viktor &amp; Rolf set out to find the original meaning of the word. The ancient meaning of the word meant casting a spell or an illusion cast by the witches. It was mostly done to change a negative feeling or environment into a positive one. Keeping this as the source of inspiration, Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren designed the Fall\'19 Collection aptly titling it, "Spiritual Glamour."

The designer duo teamed up with fellow Dutch artist Claudy Jongstra, the person responsible for recreating the Burgundian Black process. It involves creating the purest and the darkest tone of black dyes with a red under color. The process involves using natural ingredients and ancient recipes which Jongstra experimented with. The color was the focus which Viktor &amp; Rolf decided to work around.

The Collection which started with a dark black ankle-length coat slowly shifted colors, design, and patterns as it went shifted from blacks to hints of reds and oranges like a sunrise to finally moving to flowers and butterflies. The collection consisted mostly of coats and dresses in various silhouette and patterns. The models were given a punk witch look which was not over the top but subtle and balanced.

This season was no different. For the Fall\'19 Couture Collection, Saab took inspiration from East Asian Culture and China. The designer was inspired by the mystical creatures and divine characters from stories which have been passed down through centuries from generation to generation. His collection notes quoted him as:
<h4 style="text-align: center;">“I was drawn to East Asia’s rich culture, and the more I let my mind dive into it, the more I explored imperial volumes within the collection, using signature touches that remain true to the Maison.”</h4>
The construction and craftsmanship were exquisite and came harmoniously together. The creative director tried to mix traditional Chinese elements with modern elements. There were trains and slit gowns, various shoulder and sleeve kinds and robes all reinterpreted but staying true to the Maison. There were unique patterns in the form of sequins work and diamond work. Belts were the chosen piece of accessories as most of the pieces were tied together with a gold band belt. Abstract representations of flora and fauna could be seen throughout the pieces in a rich palette of explosive colors. The whole Fall\'19 Collection was elegant and lavish, to say the least.

  array('post_name' => 'fall-2019-couture-maison-margiela','post_title' => 'Fall 2019 Couture: Maison Margiela','post_content' => 'John Galliano of Maison Margiela offered the Fall\'19 Couture Collection in continuance with his last collection. Before he was feeling the excess of consumerism. This fall he wants to talk about the feeling of decay which follows with our over-dependence on consumerism. For Galliano, it was about re-connecting with oneself and depending on the power of instinct. In a podcast that accompanied the show John Galliano put his thoughts in words with:
<h4 style="text-align: center;">“Before, we were feeling the excess, and now I’m feeling we’re in decay, reflected by the breakdown of social structure. I’m feeling impulsive and anarchic.”</h4>
For the Fall\'19 Couture Collection, Galliano wanted Maison Margiela to focus on two things. The first he called, “projective filtrage.” He wanted to depict the over-saturation of technology and how today people are always walking through some kind of projection. To show that, the runaway had light projected coed imagery over real and digitalized fabric. This was his way of showing a conflict between impulses and their dependence on technology.

The second important focus of the Fall\'19 Collection was the concept of, "nomadic cutting." This refers to the process of taking a piece of familiar garment and transforming it into some other piece of novel garment. Galliano decided to focus on jeans (trousers) for the Fall\'19 Collection. He turned the jeans upside down, inside out and used them as a bustier, cape, upside down skirts, etc.

Galliano also discussed how he is working towards inclusivity and that his pieces are all gender neutral.

<h4 style="text-align: center;">“I wanted to step it up a notch for myself, to push it into something that has a little more theater. It’s the idea of an anarchic woman who comes through the château and all of the elements of what you’d find there. I like the idea that the château wasn’t perfect. It was part of the way I discovered the spirit and the girl of this show.”</h4>
</blockquote>
With this statement, Clare Waight Keller, the artistic director of Givenchy presented the Fall\'19 Couture Collection. The collection was titled "Noblesse Radicale," which means "radical nobility." The Collection was a modern spin on what royalties used to wear back in the 18th Century. Keller deconstructed this era and reconstructed with a wild spirit of her own.

The Collection started with a black and white dominance of dresses and gowns, followed by a palette of soft pink frocks and capes, yellowish golden in evening wear, shades of blue and lavender for silhouettes gowns. She used a lot of sequins work, floral motifs, lace, and brocade work for the women wear whereas the men had sequin work and embroidery on their pieces.

But her most beautiful pieces were the gowns with the feather work. The gowns had feathers sprouted from them and in Keller\'s words represented “bird woman trapped in the house.” The feathers gave a whimsical look to the whole piece yet they somehow made the gown feel rooted. Overall the whole Fall\'19 Collection was refreshing and gave Keller an opportunity to show her wilder spirit through the collection.

As his guests started entering his studio for the Fall\'19 Couture show they were welcomed with iced lollies and champagne flutes. The show saw people from various industries around the world mingling together before the show. Once the show started, it was all about the runway.

The designer mentioned how the Fall\'19 Couture revolved around the idea of hoodies shown in different formats and pieces in conical ways. The opening piece was a quilted jacket which looked like it was made of fur. But to everyone\'s surprise, it was an optical illusion. Gaultier had used a photo print of red fox on satin jacket using the trompe-l’oeil effects. This did not mean the PETA protest targeter was completely off using pelts and furs in his clothing as he quoted:
<h4 style="text-align: center;">“Going forward, if I use fur, it will be only recycling. I like fur, I’ve always liked it, but I think that since the world is already full of clothes and full of furs, there is no need to kill any more animals. Maybe with old furs, you can create new looks.”</h4>
Having said that, feathers were also used as plaid, print, or rainbows in the pieces. He hit the archives to bring back the Victor Vasarely print and revamp the leopard pelt sequin piece. His bridal gowns were uniquely done with zigzag pleats. The whole collection was filled with pieces offering visual gags and comic-book silhouettes.

The Collection was inspired by the folk style of the late \'80s and early \'90s. The designer chose a color palette of black and white with pastels mostly in the shades of blue and pink. He also used a lot of crystals and sparkles in a balanced proportion. The whole collection had tailored jackets with trousers which had the ease and look of wearing pajamas taking the audience back to the \'80s when this style was in fashion. The designer also used net dusted with a handful of nets for tops and over the trousers to give a more free-flowing look to the piece. In his show notes he said:
<blockquote>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">“The impression is that of a clear water surface reflecting a ray of moonlight or sunlight,”</h4>

There were also some maxi skirts and tiered dresses which were thrown in the mix. The Fall\'19 Collection couldn\'t have been complete without gowns and they were many that caught the eyes of the audience. Elegant gowns in soft pastel shades and black and white palette are something one can be sure to see on the red carpet this year worn by many of the stars some who were also in attendance for the show.

The House of Dior has become synonyms with luxury couture since it\'s inception after World War II, 70 years ago. It has now become an iconic brand with global influence. Dior: From Paris to the World, is an exhibition which surveys the brands legacy and influence over these past seven decades. It traces the history of the luxury fashion house to its current offerings and provides a glimpse of what the brand has to offer in the future. It is an extension  “Christion Dior: Designer of Dreams,” the 70th-anniversary extravaganza that Florence Müller curated. The exhibition concluded in Paris in 2017 and since then has been installed in various museums around the world. Now, it has opened up at the Dallas Museum of Art, Texas. It will be on display from May 19 till September 1.

The exhibition is mirrored to their previous installment Denver Art Museum from last fall. The first thing that attracts the onlooker is the 40-foot-high Barrel Vault. It profiles Dior\'s work himself followed by the subsequent creative and artistic directors the brand has seen over the years. It shows their work for the fashion house and how they have carried Dior\'s vision in the 21st Century. These directors include works and visions of  Yves Saint Laurent (1958–1960), Marc Bohan (1961–1989), Gianfranco Ferré (1989–1996), John Galliano (1997–2011), Raf Simons (2012–2015), and Maria Grazia Chiuri (2016–present).

Dior: From Paris to the World will showcase around 200 pieces of Haute couture dresses, accessories, photographs, original sketches, runway videos, and other archival material. This exhibition has added 32 new dresses in the exhibition since it debuted in Denver which includes 13 pieces by Christian Dior himself along with six new dresses from its current creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri.

The exhibition also brings together the special bond Christian Dior shared with the city of Dallas. Visionary merchant, Stanley Marcus invited Christian Dior as a recipient of the 10th annual Neiman Marcus Award “for distinguished service in the field of fashion.” He along with Salvatore Ferragamo, Norman Hartnell and Irene were awarded in the fall of 1947. “To reach Dallas, Texas, I had to cross the ocean and enter the New World,” recalled Dior. In return, Marcus remembered Dior to be "very shy."

The soundtrack was from the eighties band, Taxi girl. The scent, a&nbsp;reminiscent of the tuberose scent created by&nbsp;Francis Kurkdjian. The&nbsp;silhouettes perfectly tailored, just as the French like it. In short the whole collection was a trip down the memory lane for Vauthier as he traced what made him want to be a designer. Backstage before the Fall\'19 runway show, the designer was quoted as saying:
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I wanted to reference the images, the silhouettes that seduced me as a child, everything that made me want to make fashion. Lesage, pleating, ruffles, there’s incredible work on the clothes. Couture is, in essence, this: the showcase for specialty skills that are quintessentially French, and Parisian.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
The Fall\'19 Collection was subtle, i.e. it was not over done in embellishments. The palette for the collection was black, white and pastel shades of sky pink and light blue. There was a bit of hand-painted floral work to give the collection a light, sweet and romantic vibe. There were boxed jackets and tailored pants giving it a touch of the 80\'s. Skirts ,ruffle front shirts, jersey and sultry dresses rounded up the collection.

This marked Virginie Viard first collection post the Karl Lagerfeld era. Viard with her debut collection paid tribute to the creative designers - Coco Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld, who have made Chanel what it is today. Both Chanel and Lagerfeld were avid readers and the library set up was a tribute to them and their love of reading. Viard herself is an avid book lover.

The designer also tried to bring the bookish love in her collection as she described a Chanel Couture woman favoring “slippers, loafers or pumps with a bow tie that reinvent the two-tone geometry of the house. Little glasses on chains give her the look of a young woman eager for culture, poetry, novels” this fall season. The Fall\'19 Couture was all about long and lean silhouettes. The daywear offered skirt suits, tweed overcoats and pleated trousers. It felt like something one can easily wear during the day and not leave them in the wardrobe for "Couture-like occasions."  There are also plenty of options for the evening wear though they were simple, clean and minimalist. Some belted dresses, silk robe coat and formal pajama sets gave a vibe of leisure and relaxation.

Virginie Viard is no newbie to the world of designing. She had been working with Lagerfeld for many years. Now, she is boldly taking steps to put her mark to the brand and is doing wonderfully well. Her collection was refreshing and artistic. But it is not easy to step into the shoes of a designer who changed the face of fashion. But one can expect interesting things from the House of Chanel in the future.

The designer duo\'s Fall\'19 Collection was inspired by art-deco and one could see that in the detailing of motifs, pearls, ostrich feathers, crystals and flower outlines in the pieces. The collection took interpretations from the artist Erté along with that of Chanel, Dior, and Paco Rabanne.

The Collection started with a color palette of white which moved on to pastel hues turning into bright shades of yellow and red. The collection had the signature mini dresses and caped gowns along with a couple of cocktail minis, tweed suits, peplum jackets and miniskirts. The collection had a mix feel of everyday wear and couture as the designer duo tried including a younger clientele to their brand. The pieces were nicely balanced to cater to a no. of occasions.

Giving a miss to the runway, the collection was spread across three rooms showcasing what the designer described as the art of the atelier followed by his obsessions. The designer released a capsule collection in collaboration with H&amp;M at the Cannes Film Festival in May bringing Haute Couture together with high street fashion.
<blockquote>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">“It’s extraordinary and unexpected. I never thought Giambattista Valli was so widely known and such an object of desire. In fact, we reached 600 million people through social media. It was a beautiful conversation.”</h4>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">The showcasing took place at the Shangri-La hotel in Paris. The first room contained pieces depicting monogrammed white button-downs and tulle skirts. The next room showed bustier dresses and mini dresses. The designer used floral embroideries of orange blossoms, dahlias and roses in his pieces. The last room showed a balance of the work he had been doing with H&amp;M. It was the complete opposite of the pieces he had been doing with a high street brand. Frothy frilled gowns, sweeping trains and cape backs in pale mint, peachy orange, and light blue highlighted the room. “They balance each other out. It’s really a luxury to take the time to do things,” Valli said.</p>

The structures were more refined but there as a n underlying simplicity to the whole collection. The designer wanted to reflect “a woman’s strong identity,” through her Fall\'19 Couture Collection along with her appreciation for  “a dress that can move, accompany and transform a woman.”
<blockquote>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>“I like simplicity but not simplification.”</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
What was different and so unlike Ferretti in this collection was also the color palette she picked for her pieces. Mostly known for picking a palette of dustier and paler hues, Feretti picked bright and bold shades of chartruese, fire red, turquoise, and fuchsia for the Fall\'19 Couture Collection. Yet, one could see the trademarks of Ferretti with the elements of romance and magic as she added a touch of eccentricity in her pieces. One can get a whimsical feel in the aquamarine gown or the winged cape over the fitted pants. The designer has also tried to increase the day wear pieces as she adds a pair of pants with a top and a couple of dresses.

The designer described his Fall\'19 Collection as “Urban, funky, jungle chic.” The young brand presented a collection which was a fusion of couture with a bit of sporty feel. Other than that there were a lot of animal prints and the silhouettes were mostly short and sexy. The dresses had a lot of beadwork, sequins, metallic lamé, and leather fringe. The color palette was dominated by gold and animal print shades with the occasional hot pink and mustard popping up here and there. The footwears were mostly animal printed strappy sandals and were a bit of a miss. The Collection showed promise but there are still ways to go for the brand. The designer will also present his first men\'s collection this season.

Couture, back in the day was never about ready-to-wear pieces, but about customizing an outfit according to the fancies of a particular client. The designer used the glided salon of 19th Century mansion\'s Fondation Dosne-Thiers in Paris instead of the runway.

Alexis Mabille had no particular silhouette in mind while creating his Fall\'19 Collection. Instead, he used his vast clientele as an inspiration to play with the contrasts of minimalist - maximal and introvert-extrovert. The diverse collection was just that - diverse, in every sense possible. Every piece had a different shape and silhouette. One could find sleek pieces along with bustier pieces, there were capes trailing corsets and dresses. There was a wrap dress alongside a collared blouse with a pleated skirt. One could find elements of elegance, romance, grand gestures along with a little bit of wit in Alexis Mabille\'s Fall\'19 Collection. It was a joyful collection indeed!

CAAFD selected the designer in recognition and to highlight the notable cause her brand is working towards during the fashion week.  Vaishali S transforms authentic Indian hand looms into wearable works of art by working closely with local weaver across the country of India. According to the brand, they are making a humble attempt to give voice to old local stories in a world where everything is freshly trending. In this endeavor of the brand, each feather light thread becomes heavier, not as a burden but as a memory, becoming a requiem for tomorrow. </span>

&nbsp;
<h5 style="text-align: center;">"A unique harmony of contemporary silhouettes, the new collection features handwoven fabrics which have been treated using techniques such as knotting, cording and hand embroidery to create
textured surfaces. It is a heirloom interwoven in culture and global appeal. The color palette leaves
an interesting trail: a vibrant splash with hints of soothing white, put together between sheers and
pops of geometric motif vocabulary," read the press notes.</h5>
&nbsp;

The SS 20 Collection was titled, "Umber" and the designer hopes it would open doors for a Glocal approach (Global + Local.) The brand strongly believes that people forge too easily into global identities, often leaving their individuality stranded. According to <span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaishali Shadangule, s</span>ubtle art is never fanatic; it aims to merge, to blend the traditional into a worldview that appeals to a wider audience. Using a sharp needle and wit, she revives Khunn, recoining elegance in thread work.The beauty of the fabric she feels is in imprints, narrated in a vocabulary of sun, stars, animals and diamonds.

&nbsp;

On the runway, the luxury brand presented with a total of 28 pieces for the showcasing. The palette was rich and diverse with an array of subdued colors. Every piece had a vibe of the summer. The collection consisted mostly of day wear and presented with a range of options. There were both flowing and fitted dresses, pants with tops and a lot of colorful loose shots. The designer also used a lot of meshes in her pieces and one could see hints of the brand\'s homeland in the way it was draped or in the weaving of a couple of outfits. What also got our attention was the footwear with the bows attached to them. They made for a fun, colorful addition to the whole attire.

The program is designed to empower and motivate recent graduates in the fashion industry. This season the CAAFD selected designer Moon Chang under this program. The recently graduated designer presented her SS 20 Collection at the New York Fashion Week. Her Collection was titled, "Hybrid Beauty." It showed Moon Chang\'s personal journey during the time she was going through PTSD.

The mood was set with the haunting yet musical music being played in the background. The models make-up was done in a way to make their eyes look swollen. It depicted the toil PTSD could take on a person. She presents a collection of 11 pieces with the focus color being black. Moon Chang described how she survived the death situation with the words "Being Cute." In her collection, she incorporates cuteness with the use of ribbons, ruffles, and flowers. The cute elements in the over sized dresses created a contrast of cuteness in ugly places and the aesthetic of massive minimalism which is what the designer wanted to show through her collection.
<blockquote>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">All the piece in the collection are based on the order of evolutionism, death to rebirth to the ugly beauty, to the hybrid beauty.</h4>
</blockquote>
For her materials, the designer wanted to show traditional couture in a hybrid manner. She did that by embedding velvet, silk, satin, organza and fallie with traditional techniques of millinery. She contrasted them with functional materials, like waterproof nylon, and heat sealed rubber. She uses these techniques to create The hybrid flowers  which translate into 2D print on silk and sequins, with stuffing, heavy embroidery, and beading to create modern camouflages.

For a designer debuting her first collection, the collection was pretty technical and one could see the through though process that went into creating the pieces. The concept of beauty in an ugly way was applauded by the audience and critics and there was just one word one could hear from everyone, <em><strong>"Wow." </strong></em>

"Are Clothes Modern?" was the subject of fascination for Maria Grazia Chiuri after she read the 1947 essay of the same name. It was penned down by Bernard Rudofsky, the Austrian-American writer and contemporary of Christian Dior. With this collection, Chuiri wanted to change the way people looked at women friendly couture. She also used the concept the architecture for the Fall\'19 Collection. The relation between Dior and architectural elements forms the basics. Clothes, Chiuri believes is our first home: We live in them, and they should be comfortable.

With these thoughts in mind, Chiuri hired Penny Slinger, a London-American artist of the 1960\'s to design the set. Slinger designed a beautiful garden with an arch swarmed over with vibrant flowers. It was the only bright spot of the whole set. A giant, gnarled tree with an ancient trunk, branches and protrusions twisted up the stairwell of Dior’s recently vacated headquarters. The tree anchored an extraordinary, enchanting enclave which showed elements of fantasy yet it was derived from the natural world. “We’re trying to celebrate and memorialize this feminine spirit, the muse… and so she is embodied in this whole work in different forms and combined and mutated with all the different elements, and so we brought the Tree of Life right into the center of the house, " Slinger added.
<blockquote>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">“In fashion, there’s the idea that there’s a minimalist, more functional world, and a decorative world that is more dysfunctional. But they’re not always contradictions.”</h4>
</blockquote>
Chiuri\'s statement flowed through her collection as she played on these contrasts. She mostly used black throughout her collection though she used different materials for her pieces( velvet, lamé, Lurex-shot chiffon jacquard) throughout her collection to bring out diversity. The collection was simple yet exquisite. The show opened with people and went on to the ball gowns. But there was a vibe of ease and comfort. The ballgowns looked weightless and there was a sense of ease as the models glided in them across the runway. Chiuri also used a lot of veiling in her looks, though they were not limited to just face masks but were also used in the clothing as mesh especially in shirts beneath coats and in skirts. Overall, her evening wear collection was quiet beautiful.

For women\'s wear the collection was a mix of A-line gowns, pant suits, skirts with tops. In the men\'s section, there were pants sported with t-shirts.

Aptly titled “Hypnosis,” the creations began with motioning on a body. The dresses came with wings made of various materials.  The dresses moved as the models moved along the runway. She also used Japanese ink-on-water technique of suminagashi to create a print of lines. Her final piece was made in the image of Omniverse had wings made of aluminum, stainless steel, and feathers.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Paraguayan Fashion Designer Maria Sonia Shines Bright with Colorful Silhouettes  - think of Spring and every bright color that comes with it and that is exactly what you will find on the runway for the Maria Sonia Showcasing at the NYFW. The CAAFD approved designer presented a collection of 15 pieces. The scenario was quite different from what you generally expect at a fashion show\'s runway. The models walked boldly, freely on the runway, lifting their trains and showing them to the audience. It was a rhythmic dance as the model twirled around to fully show their outfits. The collection consisted mostly of gowns and cocktail dresses. Though the silhouettes were mostly structured, there was a sense of free flow in Maria Sonia\'s pieces. Overall, it was fun and vibrant.</span>

It showed Moon Chang\'s personal journey during her PTSD experience. The mood was set with the haunting yet beautiful music being played in the background. The models make-up was done in a way to make their eyes look swollen. She presents a collection of 11 pieces with the focus color being black. The cute elements of ribbons and ruffles in her oversized dresses created a contrast of cuteness in ugly places. Moon Chang, as one of CAAFD favorite brands, never disappointed.

And on the runway during the NYFW, she delivered a collection that was airy and floral. Anna Sui took inspiration from  mid-20th-century artist Lila de Nobili who was a costume designer, set designer, and illustrator. Nobili\'s drawings formed the context for Sui\'s Spring/Summer 2020 Collection.

The collection consisted of 54 pieces and had a wide array of clothing pieces to choose from. There were chiffon dresses and ponchos over pants. Also, on the runway were mesh tops, tanks, tunics, quilted and tweed jackets. One could also spot a kaftans, windbreakers, and knitwear\'s in the collection. The collection was brought together by a common thread of floral and geometric embroideries, use of ruffles and feathers.  The collection was rounded up by quirky colorful printed socks which could be seen through the different footwear of platform shoes, boots, and sandals. Overall, the collection was light, layered and whimsical.

Think of this brand and the first thing that comes to mind are evening gowns in contemporary and sophisticated designs and it was the same for this season. The collection was titled, "<em><strong>KHARI BULBUL</strong></em>" and with the tagline, "<em><strong>When Fashion meets Perfection.</strong></em>" The Spring/Summer 2020 was vibrant in every way from it\'s color palette to the diverse designs of evening gowns. In picking a palette the designer  picked a range that was spread across light heather blues and pastel pinks to purples and tangerines. The whole collection was dominated by fringes and ruffles. Other than that, the designer also used organza, chiffon and silk in his gowns. The designer showed constraint in his collection because even though the materials used were heavy, the gowns never crossed the line and became too much to handle.  A beautiful, fun collection to start the New York Fashion Week.

The pieces mostly had simple silhouettes and the collection mostly consisted of A-line gowns and sleek cocktail dresses. The designer also threw in some pants and jumpsuits along with a bit of swimwear. The trains were simple and graceful. Creative Director, Nguyen Cong Tri picked a palette which was as colorful as the season of Spring. The colors of the rainbow were on display individually in the dresses and also in his finale piece, the rainbow dress. Cong Tri\'s beautiful short dress which was made of rainbow-colored feathers impressed us not to mention steal the show as well.

With beautiful, inviting and calming colors of white, coral and shades of blue, the collection had something for everyone. The designer perfectly balanced his collection between day wear and evening wear. With printed floral patterns and elegant beadwork, his day wear collection was minimalist yet modern. One could easily imagine sitting by the ocean in some of these pieces and enjoying a breeze. There were day dresses, jumpsuits, kaftans and shorts and jacket sets. For the evening wear, one could find a couple of fur coats and gowns with plunging necklines.

The designer collaborated with designer Ashley Longshore for his art-inspired finale piece. Longshore who also closed the show for Basso hand painted 15 yards of a floor-length trail which she wore for the finale. She hand-painted a matching pair of trousers which Basso was spotted wearing. If you ever plan on taking a vacation by the beach, we suggest you look at Dennis Basso\'s Spring/Summer 2020 Collection.

His name over the years has become synonyms for his professional wear especially the suits.

The palette picked for this season was quite neutral with a couple of pieces in red. Tahari brought a softer touch to his office to wear chic outfits. There were mini skirts, mini suits along with flowing maxi dresses. A couple of minimalist gowns were also thrown in the mix. Not everything from the collection fits the classic Tahari creations, but we didn\'t really mind the freshness the whole collection had. Polka dots and animal prints added an element of fun. We were especially digging the calf-length beige trench coat with the cheetah print lapel and the polka-dot bucket hat. They just gave a cheeky nod to Elie Tahari\'s Spring/Summer 2020 Collection.

The outfits were well color-coordinated (mostly monochromatic). The silhouettes were sleek and simple.

His return Collection for Spring/Summer 2020 was that of evening looks. It was appealing, poetic and romantic to say the least. The Brooklyn Bridge could be seen from the Pier 17 post-industrial studio and on the inside, there was the dim lighting and just the right amount of hints of bushes and flowers. Nature and Romance. The ambiance was set alright!
<blockquote>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">“It’s about beauty. I have never been edgy and cool. I don’t know how to do it. I want to do my best version of beauty.”</h4>
</blockquote>
The palette picked was very soft and subtle:  light greens, warm-toned pinks, mesh nudes, black and white. What was new here was that all the fabrics for the pieces were hand-washed.  It gave Wu\'s piece a crinkly quality and also some three-dimensionality. He played with different materials, raw-cut edges and textures throughout his collection. The silhouettes were clean and precise. He also used a lot of ruffling textures to give the dresses a variety of necklines. When it came to designing, the designer took inspiration from his photographer friend Maxime Poiblanc\'s images of fragile and dried flowers. He printed these flowers on a couple of pieces like a pencil skirt with matching bralette, some dresses, and gown and on a pair of pants again with a coordinated bralette.

He ended the collection with tulle gowns with tiny ruffles which gave a very simplistic vibe but were absolutely gorgeous. There was a sense of free flow in all Jason Wu\'s pieces this season. You do not need the utmost important "red carpet" sort of event to pick a piece from this collection. We found it very wearable for any occasion which one feels is close to oneself.

I know, it\'s a lot to take in, but that\'s what you will find in Jeremy Scott\'s Spring/Summer 2020 Collection which he presented at the New York Fashion Week. The designer took inspiration from Van Halen front man David Lee Roth, Jem and the Holograms and the Misfits this season. The designer in his own words just wanted to have some \'fun\' and wanted his collection to be all about escapism.

There was so much happening on the runway, it as difficult to keep track. Their metallic leather mini dresses, crinkled tinfoil biker jackets, animal prints on different pieces from legging\'s, skirts to mini dresses to the swimwear and boots. Large printed patterns and colorful electric prints dictated a lot of pieces in the collection. There were men\'s and women\'s pieces made of patches of panties, the jury is still out on whether it was absurd or futuristic.

One cannot, however, also get over the serious craftsmanship that Jeremy Scott put in his pieces. It was all in the detailing for the designer. Other than the use of metallic, lurex, sequins, and lamé in the collection, which is quite visible to the naked eye there were also patches of fishnet, touches with chain-mail scraps, and puffy silver piping is done minutely in his pieces. If this is the future of fashion, Summer 2020 next year will be pretty interesting!

It brought an ease to the glamour that we wanted to capture in the clothes,” said Badgley post show.

The designer duo\'s collection consisted of 51 pieces. The color palette was inspired by the island of Barbados. The designer duo took inspiration from the colors of vegetation, the floral and the lagoon shades. When it came to the designing on could find bouquets of wildflowers,  hibiscus, and poppies along with tropical leaves splashed across the diverse range of pieces.

Badgley Mischka\'s collection consisted both of day wear and evening wear, and we couldn\'t pick what we liked more. The Spring/Summer 2020 Collection consisted of belted frocks, some power suits, printed dresses, and kaftans. The swimsuits came with blazers and coordinated tops. For the evening wear, there were a plethora of gowns to choose from and evening dresses to choose from. The whole collection felt light and welcoming. It felt like a vacation getaway indeed!

This season the focus was on three designers who presented their Spring/Summer 2020 Collections at the New York Fashion Week: LIE, IISE, LEYII.

LIE (Life is Expression) provides modern women\'s wear with their playful take on masculine-feminine duality. Their Collection had used bold colors and elevated silhouettes. There was a variety of materials used in the collection. One could see the soft features which gave the collection a romantic vibe.

IISE incorporates street interpretation pieces from Korean Culture. The pieces are made exclusively in Seoul. The brand reinterprets the concept of \'Chaebol,\' a tradition specific to South Korea, representing family owned companies. The designer duo Terrance Kin and Kevin Kim use combinations of Korean fabrics and techniques and mix of traditional and modern design aesthetics to bring something new from the east side of the world.

Rounding up the designer from Concept Korea was LEYII. It is a contemporary brand on women\'s femininity. For the Spring/Summer 2020 Collection they presented their collection, "Blossoming flower, blossoming love." They wanted to portray the synergy between the beauty of a blooming flower and a woman on the cusp of falling in love. LEYII used natural draping\'s in their minimal and unique designs to put their point across to their audience.

As the designer dealt with the hardships in his life, he also felt immense gratitude to the people who loved him and stood by him during this time. This group included his finance and a group of friends whose requests formed the basis of inspiration from Brandon Maxwell\'s Spring/Summer 2020 Collection.

The designer surprised the audience as he debuted his men\'s wear collection this spring. The palette was that of red, lilac, and emerald. The collection consisted of suits, coats, sweaters paired with jeans. His tailoring skills were fully on display in the men\'s wear. In the women\'s department, the designer focused on daywear as his friends requested something they could wear in everyday life. The designer used a lot of denim in the collection. There were seaters paired with denim jeans, blazers over skinny jeans or pants along with <span>button-down</span>&nbsp;blouses paired with skirts and shorts. There were also jersey dresses and evening gowns. Overall, the collection had something for every occasion.

Siriano took inspiration from Louisiana artist and gallery owner, Ashley Longshore.  “I was inspired by surrealism and a lot of Ashley Longshore’s work and playfulness and women’s empowerment. I love her use of color and texture, that mix of playfulness and seriousness." So much so that the designer invited the artist to be a part of the show. Longshore took to the canvas and live painted some of Christian Siriano\'s muses as the models walked the runway.
<h4 style="text-align: center;">“I wanted the collection to feel playful, colorful, bright, and romantic but still powerful and exciting,”</h4>
The collection had 63 pieces in total and while the main focus was on evening wear and gowns, there were also options available in the form of jumpsuits, tops with skirts and sleek dresses to cater to a wider clientele. We loved the diverse color palette Christian Siriano picked this season. Other than classic black and whites, the designer played with hues of green, blues, pinks and yellow. Just as much the palette was diverse so was the materials the designer played with. There were eye catching motifs, a lot of ruffles, tulle\'s, shines and beading. He also played with a variety of fabrics and laces this season.

Another thing we loved about the show was that there were male models on the runway in female attires. Talk about gender fluidity, and we are all game for it. The collection\'s last pieces were gowns, with all the ruffles and elegance they were some of his pieces. We couldn\'t take our eyes off the rainbow. With stars like Lucy Liu, Alicia Silverstone, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ashley Graham, Marsai Martin, Jeannie Mai etc in attendance and with the award season around the corner, we are sure to see some of these gorgeous pieces on the red carpet soon.

Han Chong\'s palette selection was all summery with the pastel hues of blue, lilac and pale yellow with the exception of hot pink and vivid-orange red thrown in the mix. The opening piece was a cotton poplin with lace trim and ruffled sleeves. The dresses had an ease to it as they came mostly in looser silhouettes. Day-wear dominated the collection with good options of frocks, shirt-dresses, and long flowing dress. The long hats added a nice touch. One may not find this season\'s Self-Portrait pieces on the red carpet of movie premiers but easily during a day out for lunch or at a family wedding.

I dove into the world of power suits and the color orange. Orange represents determination, success, freedom.”  Said Sally LaPointe</h4>
Sally LaPointe presented her Spring/Summer 2020 Collection at Spring Studios during the New York Fashion Week at the Spring Studio\'s gallery. The color orange was a running thread from the set decor to the whole collection. The bold and vibrant collection is what Sally LaPointe is known for and that is what she delivered this season as well. For a runway, LaPointe laid down a plush extra-wide mandarin orange carpet. The 21-feet carpet extended to form a wall backdrop as well.

In terms of the collection, it was dominated by blazers. Capes and drapes were also a recurring element throughout the collection. Sally LaPointe picked up a palette of white, varying shades of emerald green and orange along with zebra prints on a couple of coats, jackets, and tops. This season, the collection was all about head to toe tailored suiting. The tailoring was clean and sharp, the silhouettes both <span>body-hugging</span> and flowing according to the pieces. LaPointe put especially emphasizes on the detailing. She also had her usual sequence detailing to add a bit of quirk. Though the collection screamed of monochromatic pieces (which were beautifully done), Sally LaPointe also played with separates split in two halves with different colors. Although it is not a new concept, it did work well in the collection.

Other than that, the accessories were also specifically curated for the season. Daryn Moore designed the block-heeled mules in various colors which were worn with every outfit on the runway. Milliner Rodney Patterson\'s Esenshe designed the custom rabbit hair velour hats which we thought were quite stylish. Overall, Sally LaPointe\'s Spring/Summer 2020 Collection was boldly happy, positive and a vibrant one!

One could see him making changes as he shortened the New York Fashion Week this season and shifted his Spring/Summer 2020 show from the glamorous Upper East Side to a disused platform of a subway platform - the Bowery stop on the J/Z line. He made sure the platform was dressed up in a complete Tom Ford Style. Similarly, his pre-show cocktails were moved from Park Avenue Armory to Nom Wah Dim Sum house. He is helming the change he wants to bring.
<h4 style="text-align: center;">“I think that it’s a time for ease and in that way a return to the kind of luxurious sportswear that America has become known for, all over the world.”</h4>
The designer took reference referenced from the 1965 famous photo of Andy Warhol and Edie Sedgwick emerging from a manhole in New York City for his collection. Defining his collection as easy in his press notes, Tom Ford opened his collection with a black jersey scoop-neck tee paired with a white duchess satin skirt. There were sportier versions of draped gowns, a jumpsuit cut to show a strappy bikini, and we absolutely in love with the leather jackets.

The highlight of the collection though was the satin blazers with nylon basketball shorts.“These torture me. I’m always fascinated by things that ‘torture me,’” the designer added. Though he did make sure the colors and prints of electric-hued satin, pink cheetah and tiger Jacquard for the blazers gave them a wild look. Ford also paid tribute to Yves Saint Laurent and Issey Miyake with his molded plastic tops in electric colors.

There was a casual athletic feel to the whole collection. Ford knows that Gucci\'s old sports styles are back in fashion. As a designer who has a stake in those styles, Tom Ford has very smartly incorporated those designs in a modern way in his Spring/Summer 2020 Collection.

It was colorful and sparkly and ridiculously over the top. The models were smiling, strutting and dancing as all of them walked together for the first round. Marc Jacobs show notes  described the Spring/Summer 2020 collection "a celebration of life, joy, equality, individuality, optimism, happiness, indulgence, dreams and a future unwritten."

In his 61 pieces for the Spring/Summer 2020 Collection, he had models wearing everything from downtown-cool graphic tees with satin pants, uptown-chic tweed jackets to slouchy corduroy, the striped-knit dresses, the patchwork jeans and the lurex turtlenecks. With this collection, Marc Jacobs also paid tribute to friends he has lost over the years. There were odes to Yves Saint Laurent ,Karl Lagerfeld, to Shelley Duvall, Anita Pallenberg, and Ann Reinking throughout the collection. The final piece a long jersey dress with a lace back was inspired by a Jeanloup Sieff photo of Marina Schiano, who passed away just this week.

The designer has been named in Vanity Fair’s 2019 Best-Dressed List. One can clearly see how much he loves to dress and this season he spread his love as he spoils people for choices with his versatile collection. His show notes ended with a final statement from Marc Jacobs:
<p style="text-align: center;"> "<em>As with closely guarded tradition, tonight is our reminder of the joy in dressing up, our unadulterated love of fashion and embracing grand gestures of unbridled expressions, reactions, ideas and possibilities.</em><em>"</em></p>

Rising musical sensation, Normani has been handpicked by Rihanna herself to star in the brands 2019 holiday campaigns and will continue to appear in the brand\'s campaign for the Spring 2020 season.

The 23-year-old motivational star took to Instagram to share this news first. “I’m the first-ever brand ambassador for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@savagexfenty</a> ♥️♥️♥️♥️✨ !!! I love you <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@badgalriri.</a>” I want all individuals to feel empowered and to embrace who they truly are. I don’t always wake up feeling the most confident and powerful, but trust and believe having my Savage X on always helps!!”

https://www.instagram.com/p/B5I091eHJvw/

Rihanna in her release said, "Normani is the perfect choice for a Savage X ambassador. She exudes confidence and power. Everything she does is executed with passion and the belief she’s going to kill it. That’s why people gravitate toward her.”

The ex Fifth Harmony wasn\'t one to hold back on her praise for Rihanna and the message she is trying to send through Savage X Fenty. In her statement, Normani said, " I was very excited and really honored, especially that the ask came from Rihanna herself. I know that this is her passion project, something she genuinely and wholeheartedly believes in and cares about, and the fact that she wanted me to be a part of that meant a lot to me," she told Vogue. “I am beyond honored to join the Savage X family as their new global brand ambassador. ‪Rihanna is always at the cutting edge and continues to push the boundaries in everything she does. The way she embraces her sexuality and exudes grace is such an inspiration to me and so many other women around the world. Rihanna and Savage X celebrate and empower women of all shapes, sizes, and colors everywhere — it’s a beautiful thing and is truly revolutionary. I am so grateful for this opportunity and excited for what’s to come with my new Savage X family.”

This is not Normani\'s first stint with the brand. She recently performed at their 2019 runway show. The show was streamed on Amazon Prime and had a plethora of celebrities performing from the likes of Rihanna herself to Halsey, Cara Delevingne and Laverne Cox. Normani was the talk of the show with her flawless performance on the hit no. "Get Busy" by Sean Paul. No wonder RiRi wanted her as the face of the campaign. It will be interesting to see what this sensational singer will do for the brand in the coming future.

  array('post_name' => 'met-gala-2020-theme-revealed','post_title' => 'MET Gala 2020 Theme Revealed','post_content' => 'The 2019 MET Gala set the bar for next year. The year 2020 also adds another milestone for the Metropolitan Museum of Art as it celebrates it\'s 150th anniversary. The highly anticipated MET Gala which is the opening for the Costume Institute’s annual fashion exhibition is one of the biggest red carpet events in the calendar year. The theme for MET Gala 2020 has just been announced - \'About Time: Fashion and Duration.\' The theme was announced by Andrew Bolton, Wendy Yu Curator in charge of the Costume Institute.

“About Time: Fashion and Duration,” says Bolton, will take a “nuanced and open-ended” approach. “It’s a re-imagining of fashion history that’s fragmented, discontinuous, and heterogeneous.” The exhibition divides women\'s garments into two sections. The first section will be a timeline of completely black looks: “It’s a very rational, regulated chronology of fashion from 1870 to 2020, the timescale of modernity.” The second section will focus mainly on white outfits with added pops of color. This is Andrew Bolton\'s plan to make us think differently about fashion and its history.

The theme for the MET Gala 2020 was influenced by French philosopher Henri Bergson\'s concept of "la durée" — time that flows, accumulates, and is indivisible — and the 160-piece collection will be a comprehensive guide to understanding how fashion and time are coupled, with Virginia Woolf serving as the "ghost narrator" with quotes being picked from her time-based books appearing throughout the exhibition.

Bolton also found his inspiration in the 1992 Sally Potter film Orlando, which was based on Virginia Woolf’s novel of the same name. “There’s a wonderful scene,” he said, “in which Tilda Swinton enters the maze in an 18th-century woman’s <em>robe à la Francaise</em>, and as she runs through it her clothes change to mid-19th century dress, and she re-emerges in 1850s England. That’s where the original idea came from."
<h4 style="text-align: center;">"Fashion is indelibly connected to time. It not only reflects and represents the spirit of the times, but it also changes and develops with the times."</h4>

The 2020 Met Gala co-chairs will be Nicolas Ghesquière, the artistic director of Louis Vuitton women\'s wear, "Hamilton" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, actresses Emma Stone and Meryl Streep, and Anna Wintour. It will take place on May 4th, 2020 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The exhibition opens to the public from May 7 until September 7, 2020. With one of the most open-ended themes the MET Gala has had in years, it will be interesting to see what kind of unusual and creative costumes the attendees will come up with this year.

  array('post_name' => 'pyer-moss-spring-summer-2020-collection','post_title' => 'Pyer Moss: Spring/Summer 2020 Collection','post_content' => 'A standing ovation is what awaited Pyer Moss and Kerby Jean-Raymond\'s Spring/Summer 2020. The designer took a hiatus skipping the NYFW in February as he thought it was not the right time for him to showcase his collection.  A bold move for the designer as his brand had won the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund in 2018. With Pyer Moss\'s Spring/Summer 2020 Collection, Jean-Raymond presented the third and the final installment of his three-part series, "America, Also." The collection was showcased to a packed house at The Kings Theater in Flatbush, Brooklyn. The series was an attempt by Jean-Raymond to highlight the untold stories of Black people and their major contributions to the American culture.

The first part of these celebrated series was showcased in February 2018 as it told the untold stories of Black cowboys, The second installment explored "What does a mundane Saturday look like when we’re just left alone and what is Black leisure wear?" The series concluded with the final installment, titled “Sister” which took inspiration from Sister Rosetta Tharpe. She was a queer Black female artist whose music became the foundation of rock \'n\' roll what is deemed as the true origin of this genre. The show was kick-started with a moving speech by “There Will Be No Miracles Here” author Casey Gerald. He spoke about Fannie Moore ho grew up in slavery. In his speech, he took the audience through 400 years of African American history and celebrate the freedom which they now have. He spoke about Sister Rosetta Tharpe and other folklore of flying Africans.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“I think relatively few people know that the sound of rock and roll was invented by a queer black woman in a church. I wanted to explore what that aesthetic might have looked like if her story would have been told,”said Jean-Raymond backstage.</strong></p>
Music has always played a huge part in every show Jean-Raymond has put for Pyer Moss and Sunday\'s showcasing was no exception. The Pyer Moss Tabernacle Drip Choir Drenched in the Blood, the crew now bigger than the last show, gave a soulful music experience to the audience with their performance of R&amp;B, gospel, and hip-hop hits. Tina Turner’s rendition of “Proud Mary,” hip-hop songs,like “Crush on You” by Lil’ Kim; “U.N.I.T.Y.” by Queen Latifah, “The Beep” by Missy Elliott, and “Money” by Cardi B made it to the playlist.

Music was also a part and inspiration for the Pyer Moss Spring/Summer 2020 Collection. There were direct references of music and female music artists in the pieces showcased. The shape of Sister Rosetta Tharpe\'s guitar was threaded through the curvy lapels of satin overcoats and in guitar-shaped handbags. There were also piano-shaped front panels and embroidered keys on shirts and cropped jackets, graphics of trousers of divas singing and performing, evening gowns focusing on draping and plissé. Along with these, there was also a collaboration with artists like Sean John and recently exonerated artist Richard Phillips who has spent 45 years in prison for a crime he had not committed. The artist took on a painting during his time in the prison and his watercolor paintings made their way on some of the pieces in the collection.

The men\'s collection was no less charming. It was colorful and extravagant and took as back to the jazz-club performers and club-goers of the Seventies. The second half of the collection took forward Jean-Raymond and Pyer Moss\'s collaboration with sports brand Reebok forward where Jean-Raymond also serves as an artistic director. The collection presented with parkas, high-collared sweatshirts, tracksuits, puffers, two-piece sets, leggings and biker shorts in a wide array of color palette. As the show closed, Kings Theatre was flipped into an after-party space. The show will probably go down as one of the most memorable ones in the history of NYFW. Whatever Jean-Raymond has in store next for Pyer Moss, we can\'t wait for it to be shown!

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a reason why they’re called the dad sneakers, it belongs to your dad and not on your feet. Let’s face it, the chunky sneakers don’t suit anything: not your dresses, not your jeans, nothing but your running tracks. It is super comfortable and so easy to wear on the daily, but this is a fashion trend that is slowly and surely dying in 2020. And we’re not sad about it, really. These chunky sneakers are slowly getting replaced by retro classic sneakers with styles that last for a really long time like the Converse. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Who doesn’t love a cold shoulder? We did. And we still own tons of cold shoulder tops in our closet. However, this fashion trend has been played out so often that when you step out in a cold shoulder now, you’re just going to look basic. Like you didn’t try hard enough. You would still look great, but you wouldn’t make any fashion statement with it on. The cold shoulder is being replaced by floral tops with nice clean lines, and we’re all up for it. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are the days for eye-catching neon hues. Yes, we loved them, and they had their share of time even though they were so difficult to style since nothing seemed to work out. But it’s time to go and for good reason. The days of neon are getting replaced by subtle neutrals, and frankly, we’re happy since neutrals make us look more polished and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">flatter our skin tones. Beiges, creams, and tans are making a comeback, and we couldn’t be happier. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t a good look in the 80s and it most definitely is not a good look now. The padded shoulders never complimented a woman’s silhouette anyway. Thankfully, this trend is on its way and fitted shoulders are making a comeback. And rightly so. A padded shoulder is not a good look on anyone, and we’re glad everyone else sees it too. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The days of stacking a million rings and necklaces are officially over. The jewelry stacking trend has surely come to an end and is being replaced by chunky statement jewelry that we think makes more of a style statement that all the stacking did. While we did love how some fashionistas were stacking their jewelry and making it seem like artwork, we are ready to embark on this new jewelry trend. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The cargo pants. What do we do with the cargo pants? It has never been a good fashion trend. Not a decade ago. Not now. And most definitely not in the 2020s. It serves no purpose, except if you have a gazillion things you need to carry around in your pant pockets. It doesn’t flatter our legs and makes us look stocky and short. Why people were still wearing it, we don’t know. But we’re glad to see it go. The cargo pants are being replaced by fitting jeans and culottes. Our butts thank you. </span>

This is a creamy and well-made formula of mascaras that allows for building volume quickly and coats our lashes easily making it stand out quickly. No wonder this product made it to our list of the top beauty products of 2019. The formula is also made with Carnauba and Olive wax that help nourish our lashes at the same time while delivering the color without any clumps. The brush has a tapered design that has wavy fibers and a curved center. The mascara wore on our lashes for up to 24 hours and didn’t flake or smudge. This is available in many shades and has won all of our approvals.

What do you say about a gloss that swears to make you look like a goddess? Why you say thank you of course! This is easily one of our favorite glosses to ever come out in the market. This is a beautiful prismatic gloss that can be worn mixed, solo or layered. Our lips felt moisturized with it on and didn’t feel sticky. It’s made with a mixture of grape, pomegranate and raspberry oils that provided added nourishment to our lips. Available in many high shine and sheer shades, the product is fragrance-free and hypoallergenic. If you’re looking for a lip gloss, try this one! You won’t be disappointed.

This prime infused blush by Elf Cosmetics is a long-wearing and matte blush that if infused with locking prier to ensure that the blush stays on your face all day. This is a beautiful blush that comes in man shades that are perfectly pigmented, are very easy to blend and stay on your cheeks naturally and flawlessly making it look like a second skin. We tried it on a day when we had multiple meetings and a long day at work, and at the end of the day, we still had the blush on our cheeks giving us a light rosy flush that flattered our skin perfectly.

Thankfully, looking sophisticated and fashionable at the same time isn’t a difficult task. Here are our top tips on how you can look polished and classy at all times.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h3>1. Personal grooming:</h3>
It always starts with the little things that add up to a whole lot more. Make sure your manicures are on point. Stick with a neutral or very subtle nail paint color that will suit most outfits rather than getting a dark or a flamboyant color that is more likely to clash with what you\'re wearing. Nail colors such as white or beige or French nails look amazing and complement most outfits.

Wash your hair every 2-3 days and keep it natural looking and clean. Your hair is your crowning glory and greasy hair never makes an impression. Keep your hair color as close to your natural hair color so you don’t have to constantly recolor it which costs a lot of time and money. Also, spending 15 to 20 minutes grooming your hair every day will make a huge difference. After getting your hair done, ask the stylist to show you how you can achieve the style yourself at home. Learn how to make easy ponytails and buns so you can still look manageable on days when you\'re running low on time.
<h3>2. Makeup:</h3>
When it comes to makeup, less is always more. Try to stay away from full coverage foundations, bold eyes, bold lips, and bold contours unless it’s for a special occasion. Stick to light or medium coverage foundations for your day to day look. If you have blemishes, hide them with concealer rather than going all out with your foundation. Try and find a signature nude lip color that flatters your skin tone and you can wear daily on the go. Take good care of your skin. Cleanse, tone and moisturize every day. Good skin is the base for a no-makeup makeup look.<a id="Qev8ykahT_tW5gO6nF7OHQ" class="gie-single" style="color: #a7a7a7; text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal !important; border: none;" href="http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/918259712" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>
<h3>3. Perfume.</h3>
A good perfume makes a world of a difference to how a lady presents herself. Try not to change your perfumes frequently. Everyone should have a signature perfume that best suits the chemistry of their bodies and adds to the overall look of the person. Look for subtle fragrances that smell heavenly and match your personality.
<h3>4. Accessories:</h3>
A rule for accessories is to go minimal with timeless pieces such as classic bags and jewelry. Don’t wear everything at once as it gives off a vibe that you’re trying too hard. Wearing a beautiful emerald earpiece? Ditch the bracelet. Keep it simple. Invest in classic bags and shoes since that is going to match countless numbers of outfits. A good bag and a good shoe can carry through hundreds of outfits and looks.

Another classic accessory for winter is a good neutral scarf. In summer, a cute necktie adds wonders to an outfit. Also, a pair of classic sunglasses will last you a long time and add to your overall polished look.
<h3>5. Wardrobe:</h3>
Stick to a color scheme. If you’re not sure where to start, neutrals are the way to go. Go with creams, whites, beiges and pale subtle pinks that make putting outfits so much easier. When you have a colorful wardrobe, you are required to buy more clothes to suit those colors. But if you have a color scheme, it’s so much easier to style a look.

Try mixing classic wardrobe staples with trendy pieces. For instance, wrap a necktie around the handle of your bag to make it look more trendy and pair it with a classic white trench coat. High necks look very chic in winter and blouses with clean lines and feminine details look great in summer.

A well-fitting outfit will look more put together than loose outfits. Take the time to research your body type to see what kind of clothes suit you the best and make purchases accordingly. Not all clothes are meant for every body type.

Never underestimate the power of a good tailor. A little expense towards tailoring your clothes to fit your body will make a huge difference in how you present yourself. Pair flowy tops with tight skirts or shorts and pair skater skirts with a tight top or a high neck top.

Make sure your clothes are ironed or steamed to keep it’s appearance presentable. Get the lint off a woolen sweater or coat with a fabric shaver. Get a sticky lint roller if you own a pet to get the fur off your clothes.
<h3>6. Feel confident:</h3>
It’s not only on the outside that matters but also how you feel on the inside. How you conduct yourself contributes to whether or not you look classy and polished. Stand tall. Keep your Chin high. Focus on getting a good Posture when you sit or stand. Keep your back straight and legs crossed when you sit. Being classy and polished is in the air you give off. You could be wearing all the right clothes and accessories and it wouldn’t matter if you didn’t feel confident in your own skin.

With a little effort, you can look polished and classy each day every day. Remember, Dressing well is a form of good manners. -Tom Ford.

Who’re we kidding? At all times! It’s weird, the more you obsess over it, the harder it seems to become. The journey from flab to fab is one paved with stones. You may be watching your food and trying to do the exercise, but some times some things just don’t work out. Worry not, for we’re here with easy weight loss tips.

https://flic.kr/p/LaBbaM
<h3>1. Water: one of the best easy weight loss tips:</h3>
Water is the heart and soul for your journey towards losing the extra weight. Not only does it purify your body of harmful toxins, but it also makes you feel fuller for longer. Often times when we feel hungry, we might actually be thirsty. The body’s mental stimulus for both hunger and thirst is pretty much the same so it is easy to confuse the two. So, whenever you feel a pang of hunger, reach for a glass of water first. If the urge remains in half an hour, grab a snack. Also, drinking water before meals has been proven to make you eat lesser than what you normally did.
<h3> 2. Move around: one of the best easy weight loss tips:</h3>
Moving around is the best thing you can do for your body. Especially if you have a desk job or a job that has you sitting for really long hours. Got a phone call? Get up and start moving around while you talk on the phone. Take your dog on an extra-long walk around the block. He will appreciate it and so will your body. Not running late? How about taking the stairs instead? Whatever you do, keep moving.
<h3>3. Eat lots of vegetables:</h3>
Vegetables are a great way for you to lose weight while feeling satiated at the time and go from flab to fab easy.  There are tons of low-carb vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflowers, spinach, tomato, lettuce, cucumbers, the list goes on and on and on. Not only do they taste good (if made right) they also keep you fuller for longer while being very low on calories and carbs. Make sure to incorporate some vegetables in your meal so you don’t feel hungry as much and are well on your way to losing all the flab.
<h3>4. Eat your food slowly:</h3>
When you’re on a weight-loss journey, it is crucial for your mind to be fooled into thinking you’re full so you don’t get the urge to eat a snack all day. You can fool your mind into thinking your hunger is satiated by eating slowly. After a few minutes when you start eating, your mind automatically begins to think your stomach is now full and you can give up eating. Also, isn’t good food supposed to be eaten slowly, savoring each and every mouth full? We certainly think so. And it helps keep us from eating too much too fast.
<h3>5. Eat a high protein breakfast:</h3>
https://flic.kr/p/p8JUDy

Eating a good amount of protein in the morning has been shown to reduce your hunger levels throughout the day. It has also been shown to reduce your cravings and the number of calories you intake on that particular day. Make yourself a high-protein breakfast consisting of eggs, tofu, protein shake smoothies or greek yogurt. Not only do they taste heavenly, but the protein also makes you feel full while boosting up your metabolism making your body burn more calories and speeding up the weight-loss process.
<h3>6. Avoid liquid calories: one of the best easy weight loss tips:</h3>
Liquid calories are the devil. You don’t know how much you’ve consumed until you’ve consumed too much and it’s now showing in your waist-line. Try and stay away from sodas, including diet soda and limit your coffees, especially if you take it with cream and sugar. Resist the urge of putting these fattening things in your body with a good old bottle of water or take your coffee black with no sugar.
<h3>7. Good night’s sleep:</h3>
Sleep your way into losing all the extra weight and go from flab to fab easily. A good night’s sleep is most important for you to lose all the pesky pounds you’ve put on. Poor sleep is one of the biggest factors in weight gain, so it is crucial for your body to be well-rested for at least 7 hours each day to function properly. People with poor sleep have been known to weigh significantly higher than those who’ve slept well. Good sleep, on the other hand, has been shown to increase athletic performance.

By taking each day at a time and trying to follow these simple steps mentioned above, everyone can win the battle against weight gain.','post_excerpt' => '','post_date' => '2020-01-06 05:15:54'),

In place of its photoshoot images are eight differently illustrated covers, intended to highlight the negative environmental impact of photoshoots. This is a statement reflecting the fashion industry’s attention towards the negative impact of the fashion ecosystem, which is actively contributing to our degrading planet.

<em>Vogue </em><em>Italia</em>’s editor-in-chief Emanuele Farneti gave reasons for the magazine\'s plan to ditch photoshoots altogether in this issue, citing the many resources that were required to create the 2019 September issue. He said there were a hundred and fifty people involved who arrived in twenty flights and ten trains. the photoshoot required forty machines and sixty international expeditions. It also involved at least 10 hours of continuous light some generated by gasoline among others.

This is the first time that Vogue is doing this, ditching photoshoots altogether and using illustration instead, which have been created by artists without any added production costs and not adding to pollution at all.

Fans are surprised to see Frank as the new face of Prada since he\'s known to keep a low profile and is rarely seen giving interviews or photoshoots. So to see him lead an entire fashion campaign is a surprise to most. However,&nbsp;this is not his first time modeling as he has already appeared in campaigns for Calvin Klein and Band of Outsiders.

The photographs for the campaign have been captured by photographer David Sims in both black and white as well as color. One image sees Ocean in a parquet-floored apartment donning a long coat, an oversized shirt, a pair of cropped camel trousers, and a slim bolo tie much similar to the look he wore to the Met Gala in 2019.

In another image, we see him in a black roll-neck sweater staring off into the distance as if caught in the moment.

Frank Ocean, the new face of Prada, has also put his own words into Prada\'s acronym and the Prada logo has been repurposed for the season. The Prada logo now reads “Programming Rhythms And Dancing Again” that has been derived from \'abstract ideas, thoughts and notions\' as described by the press release issued by the label.

Actor Austin Butler, as well as director Nicolas Winding Refn, are also the faces for this season of Prada\'s new campaign and they look great as well.

The year 2020 is going great for Frank Ocean who has recently been announced to headline Coachella this year. We last heard from Ocean in 2016 of his album Blonded, and it only seems fair to say he\'s making a major comeback this year after a hiatus of 4 years.

The selection process for a color stars well a year in advance of the announcement. The process requires thoughtful consideration and trend analysis. Pantone’s color experts at the Pantone Color Institute comb the world looking for new color influences for the selection of color. This includes the entertainment industry, traveling art collections and new artists, fashion, all areas of design, popular travel destinations, as well as new lifestyles, playstyles, and socio-economic conditions. Influences may also stem from new technologies, materials, textures, and effects that impact color, relevant social media platforms and even upcoming sporting events that capture worldwide attention.

Jason Wu Collection Fall 2020 was just that. It was beautiful and romantic. Designer Jason Wu’s inspiration for the Fall 2020 Collection was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orchids and Egon Schiele. Everything from the ambiance and runway to the collection was in sync with the theme.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jason Wu collaborated with Australian expressionist artist Jessica May Underwood this season. She is known for her erotic, and deeply psychological paintings, and her graphic orchid patterns were reproduced by Jason Wu on his pieces. The designer this season worked with a color palette of violet, teal, turquoise, and fuchsia. The whole focus of the collection was on craftsmanship and a play with the fabric.</span>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>“With this collection I really wanted to showcase New York’s craftsmanship because we don’t get credit for it.” </strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The opening piece was a hyper cape which set the tone for the evening. The Swarovski crystal work on the tulle dress was refined and elegant. Similarly, the play with feathers on the part frock made for a sophisticated piece. The pieces were timeless and crafted with perfection. The whole collection just went on to show the fineness and experience that the designer Jason Wu possesses after a decade and a half in the fashion industry.</span>

  array('post_name' => 'helmut-lang-fall-2020-collection','post_title' => 'Helmut Lang: Fall 2020 Collection','post_content' => '<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas Crawson, creative director of Helmut Lang, served his first solo collection at the NYFW. He and his team decided to push the envelope of fashion-forward as he skipped the runway and decided to get artistic this season. There were a series of inclusive photos of models and friends wearing Helmut Lang and walking around Christopher Street in New York City. The place is known for its LGBTQ presence. Helmut Lang’s Fall 2020 Collection was inspired by engaging pictures taken by Canadia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">artist, curator, and activist Sunil Gupta, titled “Christopher Street 1976.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by Gupta’s work and his desire to create an open space for gay people back in 1976, Crawson invited the artist to create a 2020 version of his series. The series was inspired by the same time, giving the collection a sense of nostalgia and retro vibe. While it featured pieces for both men and women, the clothing was quintessentially chic. Slit skirts, sheer turtlenecks, shirts, and inconspicuous dresses were used to give the whole collection a gender fluidity. There was mostly work-wear given a modern touch while keeping the essence of a unisex collection. Softly draped silks and practically tailored coats rounded the whole collection. Thomas Crawson is hosting the exhibition in the downtown Manhattan store of Helmut Lang. The 2020 colorful series are put along with black and white frames of Christopher Street 1976. </span>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>“When Sunil was photographing, I think the idea of queer liberation was quite solely amplifying a gay male identity, and I don’t think that reflects what 2020 looks like,” the designer says. “I wanted to make sure that if we were going to show 1976 versus 2020, that 2020 kind of looked like the broader expanse of what queer rights should be.”</strong></h4>

  array('post_name' => 'self-portrait-fall-2020-collection','post_title' => 'Self-Portrait: Fall 2020 Collection','post_content' => '<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever one thinks of Self-Portrait, he or she thinks of feminine outwear dresses with all that frills and ruffles and lace.  But for the Fall 2020 season, we were all in for a surprise. Designer Han Chong decided to get done with all that girly elements (well almost) and replace it with sharp suiting and sleek fittings. In his way, he is also trying to fit in what his clientele wants from the brand, like a head-to-toe wardrobe from Self-Portrait. Chong is trying to move his brand forward by staying ahead of the future.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Han Chong’s inspiration this season came from the idea that there are too many distractions in our lives. From political turmoil to climate change, there is so much going out in the world that women just need to fuss a little less at least about clothing. There were blazer dresses, bustier jumpsuits, and peak-lapel rompers compared to his usual going out dresses.  The focus was on tailoring, draping, and sharp silhouettes, Han  Hong couldn’t resist putting a little bit of sparkle and his usual flair here and there. His lace dresses with jeweled buttons and rhinestones were dazzling and stole the show. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as Han Chong takes Self-Portrait into the future and expands his outlook on female wear, he still knows how to add a bit of playfulness to the collection. The fuchsia pink gown and little black dresses balance out the fitted leather coats and give a lightness to the whole collection. </span>

Transvestite Miss Fame and Nicky Doll also walked for Valli\'s runway. Moreover, American Fashion designer Rick Owens was also pictured on the ramp in his signature black platform boots.
<h2> Giambattista Valli Fall 2020 Collection</h2>
Valli never failed to attract by her outstanding and unique collection. From pink to black, every other piece was given major feminine vibes with a good sense of fashion trend. White was also very much in his magnificent collection. Evidently, we all are now familiar that he has been putting out so much effort in making his very own versions of iconic tweed jackets. Playing with fur is not easy, but when it comes to Valli, it’s merely a piece of cake for him. Homogeneous furry sweater along with skirt looked tremendously unique—kind of no words for his creativity. Glittery embroidered black short suit and same designed jacket with baggy pants gave such a fantastic feel to the whole women runway look.

Giambattista Valli Falls 2020 collection, without a doubt, amazed everyone once again with monochromatic suits, which looked flaunting on the models. From a cocktail dress to baggy jeans stuffed pants and with the innovative fur designed suit, he surely made people say ‘Wow’ to his classic yet very liberal runway show.

How can anyone ignore the snake prints on the fabric? Moreover, the snake accessory around the neck, which is something that seems so unique and powerful. See-through net design, off-course, something anyone can pull off on formal events, but the way Valli portrait is magnificent. Sequins baggy pant with the glittery zig-zag shirt was turning over some major street-style luxurious feels. It fell with all the right intentions. Furthermore, the coolest style, which was noticed with an impression, was the net piece kind of fabric on the head. Ah! It looked extremely awesome.
Giambattista Valli falls 2020 collection, In short, stole the whole show by giving his innovative yet wearable designs to the fashion industry.

The designer will be marking her 10th year in the Fashion industry this September. Other than that, she also made an important announcement that she will be dropping Sally from her brand name to give the brand longevity and help it expand in other areas like accessories. Coming to her Fall 2020 Collection, it was everything we have come to except Sally Lapointe: bold, glamorous, and unapologetic.</span>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"The Fall 2020 Collection started with the idea of there being no rules. Drawing inspiration from the attitudes of muses like Grace Jones and Bianca Jagger, these clothes are unapologetic. Ditch the conventions – just be you.” </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The designer picked up a rich color palette from lime green to turquoise and from chartreuse to violet. Even though her collection was that of evening wear, one could not spot a single gown in the 37 piece collection. It is not like we did not want evening gowns, but we did not miss them either. Sally Lapointe brought a modern touch to the concept of evening wear as she opened her show with an electrifying glam suit. She stuck to her monochromatic dressing style as she introduced her models in leather pants, cozy knitwear, trousers, stylish tops, scarfs, and jackets. We particularly love the crop sweater paired with a mini leather skirt in a nude shade. The fur jackets added a nice touch to the collection. The whole collection was what one could term as sexy but in the most refined and elegant way possible. What was new was the collection of bags that Sally Lapointe introduced this season as she ventures into the world of accessories. The designer ended the show on a promise of launching more accessories in the coming seasons.</span>

The designer had his cheer team in the form of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lexi Brumback and Gabi Butler - the  stars of the Netflix series “Cheer.” They hooted and hollered so loudly that the models on the runway couldn’t help but chuckle at the stars before resuming their role on the runway.

Talking about his collection Brandon Maxwell said that, this season, he was, </span>“Thinking deeply about those wardrobing items that are made to last.”

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The collection was excellent, to say the least, though there were a couple of misses in his eveningwear collection. There were less precision and finesse in his gown. We are not really sure if it is a new trend to let go and be a little loose or just the result of doing too much at once. The daywear collection or his sportswear version for both men and women felt like it fitted right in. The leather pants with biker jackets, shirt dresses, and corduroy suits were on point. It looked like he was absolutely comfortable in the men’s department, even though it is new territory for him. In the eveningwear, he nailed the black liquid silk cocktail dress. We were in complete awe of it. His finale piece, the red gown, was absolutely on fire. But one cannot help but imagine that he could have done a bit more when it came to his eveningwear collection.</span>

About his collection at fashion week, Hilfiger said, “Lewis wanted to expand from just men’s to genderless and Unisex, and we thought it would be cool to bring a female musician into the mix”. Further explaining his genderless collection, he said, “bring three points of view has helped us create something everyone is happy with.
<h3>Ready to Wear Spring/Summer Collection</h3>
We all agree that he beautifully portrays his set of mind behind his massive hit collection. He really wanted that every other gender can come to his store and buy Tommy Hilfiger 2020 spring/summer collection without being in dispute. Undoubtedly, he is a man of great foresightedness.

His collection incorporates neons, white, and black sportswear, which looked incredible and vintage at the same time. The bottom pants were having some ruffle detailing, which brings a whole new feel for the look of the models. Hats on top with bags at the back gave major summer/spring sports goals. The interesting scarf grasps beautifully around the neck made the vibes more spectacular. The best part of his runway was the flag designed suits. They were undoubted, showing the slogan “Unity” and “Oneness”. Shirt printed with ‘Loyalty’ shows more of his connection with London. As Hilfiger vocalizes, “We are a truly global brand”. Definitely, he proved himself very well by bringing in the flag theme, which gave a loud and clear meaning.

Moving towards the fabric, for the very first time, he brings in washable fabric without water, which sounds so cool. Related to his phenomenal collection, he stated, “I like remaking them: a sleeve from my one and a collar from another. People are buying Tommy vintage anyway, so we should be selling it". The collection further consists of jackets and spring season coats, which looked spectacular. The way two models walked the Ram together shows how much he believes in unity.
<h3>Why His Fashion week took place in London?</h3>
Now it’s more clear why the Fashion week took place in London. He really wanted to become sustainable as he said this himself, too. One of the reasons was also that his ongoing collaborator, “Lewis Hamilton,” grew up in London. Moreover, on asking about this from Tommy, he said, “Doing what we are doing suits London very well, in general”.
